Fertilizers are derived from animal waste and bones, pesticides are used on crops to kill insects, bees are kept in hives to pollinate almonds, worms are killed by tilling fields. All food involves death.\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e That's completely correct, it is almost impossible to avoid being complicit in suffering with our current food chain. Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals [...]. Raising an animal from forcible impregnation to their untimely death merely to satisfy our desire for taste is not comparable to deaths we have no way of avoiding as consumers.  \n\u003e - Definition of veganism verbatim from [The Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism)\n\n## Detail - Analytic\n\n### Intention vs Accident\n\nEd Winters (aka Earthling Ed) hits the nail on the head with his comparison in his book '30 Non Vegan Excuses'.\n\n\u003e If someone was driving their car and they accidentally hit a dog, that would not be the same as if they purposefully drove after the dog until they ran them over.  \n\u003e - Ed Winters - 30 Non Vegan Excuses - p72\n\nIntention matters in the morality of your actions. The unintentional deaths of earthworms when tilling, or field mice when harvesting are not _necessary_ for the production of crops, it is not the intention to kill animals when harvesting crops. It is the definitionally the intention when raising animals for slaughter.\n\nThis distinction falls down somewhat when we consider pesticides, animal-based fertilizers, and beekeeping for pollination. This is why some vegans seek out foods from [vegan farms](https://www.viva.org.uk/what-we-do/vegan-farming). Ultimately however each person's 'possible and practicable' is a line they have to draw for themselves and this may not be within the means or motivations of every vegan. It is not necessary to be perfect to be vegan.\n\n### Moral Consistency\n\nTrying to trip vegans up by exposing real or imagined inconsistencies is a common avenue of argument against veganism. The reality is that vegans (being human) are typically not perfect. Vegans are subject to the constraints of time, money, knowledge, and availability of resources amongst a million other factors. We quoted the definition of veganism in our quick response but it's so important it bears repeating: \n\n\u003e Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals  for food, clothing or any other purpose.  \n\u003e - [The Vegan Society - Definition of Veganism](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism)\n\nEach person's 'possible and practicable' is a line they have to draw for themselves. It is not necessary to be perfect to be vegan. \n\nThis is not an excuse to have a steak when there isn't a vegan option at the restaurant. It is only that it is necessary to recognise that it is nearly impossible to without cruelty to animals or people while still participating in a 21st century society, and to forgive ourselves for the things we cannot avoid.",

We are just animals ourselves, it's natural.\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e Animals do eat other animals, but animals are not who we look to for examples of moral behaviour. We wouldn't say it's okay to kill members of our own species because animals do it. Or rape one another because animals do it. Just because something is 'natural' does not make it right.\n\n## Detail - Analytic\n\nThis is a classic example of the Appeal to Nature Fallacy\n\n\u003e [The Appeal to Nature Fallacy] is the belief that what is natural must be good [...] and that which is unnatural must be bad [...].\n\u003e - Logically Fallacious - Bo Bennet - 2012\n\nEarthquakes are natural, pain is natural, our own death is natural, but just because they are natural does not mean that they are good. Cars are 'unnatural', pain relief is unnatural, food standards and sanitation are unnatural, but that does not mean they are bad.  \n\n## Detail - Emotive\n\nTied up in this argument is often the idea that vegans are 'disconnected from the harsh realities of the world' or 'too weak to do what's necessary'. The actual fact is that veganism stems from a _very real_ understanding of what it means to eat meat. Vegan documentaries are full of footage from slaughterhouses and factory farms, places that people who eat meat typically never see let alone visit. \n\nIt is hard to imagine anything more 'disconnected from the harsh realities of the world' than taking a plastic package of meat and consuming it without ever having even _thought_ of the animal which it came from.\n\n\n",

Everyone is allowed their own opinion even if you don't agree with it \n2. My opinion informs my actions through choice\n3. My actions, choices, and opinions should all be afforded the same level of acceptance\n\nThis takes a freedom of thought/speech type model and applies it to actions under the guise of 'choice'. And it works intuitively because there are scenarios in which this makes sense!\n\n- It's my choice to drop out of uni\n- It's my choice to dye my hair\n- It's my choice to spend all my money on a holiday instead of saving it for a house\n\nThe key thing that these scenarios have in common, and the necessary component for them to have the freedom of speech/thought model applied to them, is that their repercussions apply only to the person making the choice. Compare this with:\n\n- It's my choice to set your house on fire\n- It's my choice to spend all your money on a holiday\n- It's my choice to kick your shins\n\nWhen the opinion \"I think it would be a good thing to set your house on fire\", which we may not agree with or even respect, is transformed into an action that affects someone other than the person that who holds that opinion, it loses its protection.  \n\nYou may think what you like, and do what you like, so long as it only affects you.\n\nEating meat _incontrovertibly_ affects others. It is unavoidable that an animal dies in order to produce meat. You *cannot* use a defence grounded in freedom of thought to justify killing. If you demand respect for your choice to kill something else purely because your choice demands respect, you need to provide an argument as to why the same respect should not be given to some-one who wishes to kill you.",
