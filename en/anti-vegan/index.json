          "rawContent": "# Argument\n\n\u003e If it's just you and a pig on a desert island surely you would eat the pig to survive?\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Responses\n\n\u003e That’s a difficult question. If it's just you and a child on a desert island  would you eat the child to  survive? \n\nor\n\n\u003e That’s an interesting thought experiment. It is designed to test the Ethics of Emergencies and whether they differ in scope from everyday ethics. That the survivors of Flight 571 turned to cannabalism to survive in an emergency was not a mandate for cannabalism under everyday conditions. Similarly, even if a vegan did kill and eat the pig in an emergency this does not justify the unnecessary killing of animals under normal conditions.\n\n## Detail - Analytic\n\n### How does the argument go?\n\nThis thought experiment is usually presented as some sort of *“Gotcha”*. \n\n\u003e If it's just you and a pig on a desert island surely you would eat the pig so you could survive yourself? Then you wouldn't be vegan anymore would you?  \n\u003e Followed by: So if you (the vegan) choose to eat the pig, then that's no different from me eating pork when I choose.\n\nThis line of reasoning is both false (as discussed shortly) and shows a misunderstanding of the scope and nature of the thought experiment:\n\n## The thought experiment\n\nThe following is a more complete version of the thought experiment:\n\n\u003eA ship sinks and there are only two survivors. You and the other survivor have washed up on a small rocky island. You know when the next boat will pass and will be able to signal help. However, you will not survive till then unless you kill and eat your companion.  \n\nConsider that the other survivor is: a child, an adult; your pet dog; a pig.  Work through the thought experiment 4 times. Each time replace the other survivor with one of the options from the list. \n\n- Do you act the same way on each occasion? \n- Why/Why not?\n\n*(When rescued it will be assumed the other washed up dead. In the case where the other was a human you will never be charged with their murder)*\n\n### Don’t sidestep the issue!\n\nThe important thing about *thought experiments* is that you *think about them*. Don’t rush at justifying an answer; it’s more important to ponder the moral implications.\n\nSome of the sidesteps that should be avoided:\n\n- I’ll eat what the pig’s eating.  *No*, there is absolutely no other food source. \n- What if the other tried to eat you, so you had to kill them in self-defence?\n- While you wait for rescue, befriend the pig who would then provide company much like your pet cat or dog would? This might deflect the argument on to another interesting discussion but it still sidesteps this important thought experiment. You will *not* survive until rescued unless you kill the other survivor.\n- This couldn’t happen because… *(numerous reasons are presented)*. Yes, the thought experiment presents an improbable scenario but one that is logically possible. However, it really does not matter if the event could occur. Thought experiments are artificial constructs designed to test specific moral principles; you might argue that all thought experiments are invalid but it is far more interesting to engage and consider the implications.\n- You can’t kill the humans; that’s murder!  (Perhaps, but let’s not confuse legality with morality. *Is* the action morally justified? *…and remember you will never be charged with murder.*)\n\n### What’s the answer?\n\nThe temptation with thought experiments is to rush to an answer and then be forced to turn cartwheels in an attempt to justify that answer. Consider: \n\n- Would you kill the animal but not a child? Is that *just* because they are human? Are you making a claim of [human superiority]({{\u003c ref \"/anti-vegan/humans-are-superior\" \u003e}})? \n- Does killing/eating the pig in any way show a weakness in veganism? (*No*, it doesn’t, as we’ll demonstrate shortly). \n- Does killing and eating the child endorse cannabalism? \n- What moral principle are you applying?\n\n\u003e  The purpose of thought experiments is to make you think about the moral implications and principles.\n\nIt’s worth repeating one more time; the purpose here is *not* to force you to answer the questions. It’s to get you to engage with the concepts and consider the moral implications.\n\n\n### Suicide is painless?\n\n\n\u003e The difficulty, my friends, is not to avoid death, but to avoid unrighteousness - The Apology of Socrates *by* Plato.\n\nCo-Author Valerie has suggested that suicide, although extreme, could be an option to consider. As a vegan, it's a pretty hard decision to make to deliberately kill a pig, or any other animal, even in order to ensure my survival. While I could regard my own life as more important than the pig's, I recognise that the pig values their life as much as I value mine. So, the choice to take the life of another sentient being seems an impossible dilemma. The alternative thought is that of suicide; why kill the pig only to live the rest of my life depressed because my actions didn’t live up to my morals?\n\nThis echoes Socrates’ thoughts that death is preferable to sacrificing our deeply held morals.  This is possibly a noble ideal as, if you kill yourself and the other survivor is another human then you provide them with the means of survival. But, does the same logic apply when your companion is an animal? Yes, they can eat your remains and live a little longer but they won’t be rescued so will slowly die from dehydration and starvation. \n\nThis opens several new and interesting questions:\n\n- Even if you decide to commit suicide wouldn’t it be kinder to kill the animal first, rather than allowing it to suffer?\n- If you do mercy-kill the animal (to avoid any unnecessary suffering) does suicide remain your option? That is; is it wrong for a vegan to eat the flesh of the now dead animal to survive?\n\nOnce again, it is not necessary to answer these questions only to consider the moral implications of the thought experiment.\n\n### It is a Fallacy not an Argument\n\nWhile a fascinating thought experiment, when presented as an anti-vegan argument, it reveals a fallacy. The carnist’s argument runs something like:\n\n\u003e[Point 1] If it's just you and a pig on a desert island surely you would eat the pig so you could survive?  \n\u003e [Point 2] Then you wouldn't be vegan anymore would you?  \n\u003e [Point 3] So if you (the vegan) choose to eat the pig, that's no different from me eating pork when I choose.\n\nIn more analytical form; this implies that if you do a specific action under emergency conditions then that action is justified under any conditions. This is clearly false. As we noted earlier, the survivors of Flight 571 turned to cannabalism, eating the deceased to survive, but this was *not* a mandate for cannabalism under everyday conditions.\n\n\u003e It is important to differentiate between the rules of conduct in an emergency situation and the rules of conduct in the normal conditions of human existence. This does not mean a double standard of morality: the standard and the basic principles remain the same, but their application to either case requires precise definitions. - The Ethics of Emergencies *by* Ayn Rand\n\nLet’s recall the definition of veganism. A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude — *as far as is possible and practicable* - all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food…\n\nIn an emergency situation the unlikely, but possible, scenario where you *must* choose between your own life and the life of another could occur. If the companion was an animal would the vegan kill to survive? I have no idea and nor, I expect, does anyone unless they were actually in that situation. But, whichever action is chosen, it in no way negates the principles of veganism.\n\nIn our thought experiment it’s not possible to survive without killing the other, so the vegan might:\n\n- place their own life ahead of their companion’s, in this emergency, without feeling they had betrayed their vegan principles.\n-  consider the principles of veganism so important that a slow death from dehydration is a preferable option.\n\n### Final thoughts\n\nIt is unfortunate this fascinating thought experiment is misused as an anti-vegan argument. When it is, it becomes a fallacy and the important implications for moral principles are lost.\n\nThe Authors have no certainty about how they would act if marooned on an island with a pig; would their survival instincts or values prevail?  What we are certain about is that, regardless of what occurs on the island, it in no way justifies or condones the  unnecessary slaughter of millions of animals for nothing more than their taste.\n\n### Citations\n\n\u003e * The Apology *by* Plato *translated by* Benjamin Jowett *also available* [online](http://web.archive.org/web/20190805122204/http://www.sjsu.edu/people/james.lindahl/courses/Phil70A/s3/apology.pdf).\n\u003e * The Ethics of Emergencies *by* Ayn Rand *in* Normative Ethics: The Virtuos Egoist *also available* [online](https://web.archive.org/web/20191020181939/https://philosophyintrocourse.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/ayn-rand-the-ethics-of-emergencies.pdf).\n\n\n",

The alternative is accepting that 'even *if* it is the case we are uniquely superior, morality requires we care for those more vulnerable than ourselves; not that we treat them as a resource'.\n\nor\n\n\u003e Superiority requires *drawing a line* that seperates two groups and *falsely* identifies one group as deservedly superior to another. Yes, humans are unique and distinct from other animals in our capacity for complex problem solving. However, pick any species and you will likely find an attribute that also makes them unique and distinct. We should celebrate difference and not deny moral consideration to those who are different.\n \nor \n  \n\u003e No unique set of abilities or characteristics, in itself, provides a criterion for ‘superiority’.  For humans to claim that humans are superior because we have specific unique attributes is just another form of prejudice. \n\n\n## Detail - Analytic\n\n### Humans are different to other animals\n\nThat’s true. Humans have a capacity for complex problem solving that is not present in other animals. But why should a set of unique abilities or characteristics equate to superiority and give us the right to do what we like to those deemed inferior? Difference and uniqueness are not synonymous with superiority. \n\n\u003e Until recently it was considered that our capacity for abstract thought made us unique. However, “there is growing literature indicating that animals are capable of causal reasoning and abstraction”  \n\u003e [Decision-Making From the Animal Perspective: Bridging Ecology and Subjective Cognition (2019)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2019.00164/full)  \n\n \n ~\n\n\n\u003e A further \"finding suggests that fish might possess far higher cognitive powers than previously thought, [igniting] a high-stakes debate over how we assess the intelligence of animals that are so unlike ourselves.\"  \n\u003e [Fish Appear to Recognize Themselves in the Mirror (2019)](http://web.archive.org/web/20191004075152/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190207142234.htm)\n\n### On Superiority\n\n\n\u003e One definition of 'Superior' is, \"of higher rank, quality, or importance\" - [Merriam-Webster](http://web.archive.org/web/20190711165845/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/superior)\n\nWhat most people forget (*or choose to overlook*) in using the term superior is that; *We alone* determine the ranking systems. *We alone* determine what denotes better quality. *We alone* determine what makes one thing more important than another. To presuppose that 'we' are superior to 'them' and to then *choose* an attribute that separates 'us' from 'them' as (somehow) demonstrating superiority is a fallacy. Identifying difference never identifies superiority even when it grants power of one over another.  \n\n\u003e \"For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for precisely the same reasons.\"  \n\u003e - Douglas Adams *from* Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, 1979\n\n\n\n### The flawed reasoning of Superiority and Domination\n\n\u003e For any X and Y, if X is superior (or morally superior) to Y, then X is morally justified in subordinating Y.  \n\u003e - *The 'logic premise' from the 'Opressive Conceptual Framework' argument* as cited by Karen J. Warren\n \n or in plain English (and, as often used in anti-vegan rhetoric) \n \n \u003e if humans are superior to nonhuman animals, then humans are morally justified in treating nonhuman animals as a resource. \n \n\nThis logic is used to claim that humans are superior to, and may dominate, nonhumans *due to some difference* that is elevated (by humans) in importance. However, without the \"assumptions  that *humans are superior* to (at least some) nonhumans, and that *superiority justifies subordination*, all one has is some difference\" - Karen J. Warren *from* The Power and the Promise of Ecological Feminism *in* Environmental Ethics.\n\nThis creates what Warren refers to as an *oppressive conceptual framework*. An example is patriarchal thinking which falsely justifies the subordination of women by men based on nothing more than difference. Warren further claims that this logic of domination, and any conceptual framework which gives rise to it, \"must be abolished  in order to make possible a meaningful notion of difference...\"\n\nWe need to move away from the oppressive conceptual framework that maintains *sameness* and only extends the moral community to those who are similar to us by application of some self-determined criteria. Warren refers to this as *arrogant perception*, resulting in a false notion of superiority which gives rise to the claim that those like us deserve moral consideration and others don't.\n\nAn alternative *loving perception* \"presupposes and maintains difference - a distinction between the self and other, between human and at least some nonhumans - in such a way that perception of the other as other *is* an expression of love for one who/which is recognised at the outset as independent, dissimilar, different.\"  \n\nA *loving perception* requires that difference be cherished rather than used as a reason for domination. That nonhuman animals are different is a reason for celebration not a reason to treat them as a resource.\n\n\n\n### A Thought Experiment\n\nSuppose we discover an alien species (or more likely an intelligent species discovers us). That species has all of our abilities along with a technology far in advance of our own. They far exceed our mental capacity, can see a far greater colour spectrum and can hear sounds outside our aural range. They can also communicate telepathically.\n\nIf humans are superior to animals because of our unique capacity for complex problem solving then these aliens, with all our abilities plus the unique ability of telepathy, must be superior to us.\n\n- Does this mean the aliens are justified in harvesting the human species?\n\nIf you believe that we can use animals *as we choose* because we deem ourselves superior (due to unique attributes) then you must accept that the aliens would be justified in using us *as they choose* for the same reason.\n\nIf you believe the aliens would act wrongly in harvesting the human species then you need to reconsider your claim that human superiority gives us the right to use animals *as we choose*.\n\n### Superiority - so what?\n\n\u003e ...to care for and about others is what being vegan is all about.\n\nEven assuming that humans' unique abilities do *as a matter of fact* demonstrate superiority it’s unclear why or how this is relevant. One of the cornerstones of morality is that we care for those less capable (or more vulnerable) than ourselves, and caring for others is what being vegan is all about.\n\n### Citations\n\n* Decision-Making From the Animal Perspective: Bridging Ecology and Subjective Cognition *by* Sergey Budaev, Christian Jørgensen, Marc Mangel, Sigrunn Eliassen and Jarl Giske in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, 2019.  \n* The Power and the Promise of Ecological Feminism *by* Karen J.

          "rawContent": "\n# Argument\n\n\u003e Veganism is often criticised for failing to adequately address specific environmental concerns; such as pest control.\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e Environmental Ethics is complex and difficult. Even assuming we can reach agreement on the definition of pest it does not automatically follow that humans *ought* to control or eradicate any species.\n\nor\n\n\u003e While the ideals of veganism are always placed first, individual vegans will differ on what, if any, actions ought to be taken. This can range from 'do nothing' (*all species have a right to life*) to 'controlling possums' (applying the golden rule of *acting to bring about the least harm*)\n\n  \n## Detail - Analytic\n\nIt is difficult to interpret how the central principle of veganism *‘avoid exploitation of and cruelty to animals'* might be applied in complex environmental considerations. \n\nHowever, before we try, a few concepts require unpacking.\n\n### 1. Veganism is a moral standpoint. \n\n\nVeganism is not a moral theory.  Veganism is a moral standpoint regarding the (mis)treatment of animals by (most) humans, either directly or by passive acceptance. We can’t expect specific moral standpoints to offer complete answers to questions that are fully or partially outside their scope.  That said, there is considerable crossover between environmental and animal concerns so intuitively we expect that vegans ought to hold a position on environmental issues\n\n### 2. What is a pest?\n\nPest is commonly defined along the lines of any “small animal which damages crops or food supplies” ([Collins](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009200032/https://www.dictionary.com/browse/pest)) or “any animal or plant detrimental to human concerns” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(organism))).  \n\n\u003e Speciesism is a form of discrimination based on species membership. It involves treating members of one species as morally more important than members of other species even when their interests are equivalent.  \n\u003e  - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism)\n\nVegans will NOT accept this definition of pest as it is 'speciesist’. That an animal’s interests conflict with human interests is not, in itself, a reason for defining the animal as a pest or for taking action against them. Where crops are concerned alternative means such as fencing, sonics, and eco-friendly organic practices are available.  \n\n## Re-defining ‘pest’.\n\n\u003e \"A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.”  \n\u003e - Aldo Leopold (1949) [The Land Ethic](http://web.archive.org/web/20191009200336/https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil3140/Leopold.pdf) \n\nAldo Leopold, the father of environmental ethics, provides a non-speciesist means to identify problematic species in \"The Land Ethic\". A species is problematic (a 'pest') when, regardless of human interest, it upsets the stability of, interrupts the integrity of, or leads to the destruction of the environment.  \n\nTwo New Zealand specific examples:\n\n### Are wild rabbits a pest?\n\n[Biosecurity NZ](http://web.archive.org/web/20191007214252/https://www.mpi.govt.nz/protection-and-response/long-term-pest-management/wild-rabbits/) lists rabbits as pests because they ‘compete with livestock, cause extensive damage to farming land, cause public nuisance...'\n\nSo, yes, they are annoying to (some) humans but they are not a ‘pest’. The reasons provided by Biosecurity NZ fail under Leopold’s criteria. If wild rabbits are a pest other more substantial, non-speciesist, reasons must be provided.\n\n### Are possums a pest?\n\nPossums occur in high numbers in NZ, breed fast and face very few predators. Without doubt possums have a major impact on New Zealands native ecosystems.\n\n[Department of Conservation NZ](https://web.archive.org/web/20190227050251/https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/pests-and-threats/animal-pests/possums/) lists possums as pests, as, “Leaves are the main part of their diet, but possums are opportunistic omnivores. They eat buds, flowers, fruit/berries and nectar, which means they compete with native birds and reptiles for food sources. The growth and life-cycle of a tree or plant is significantly affected when all parts of it are eaten. Possums also have ‘favourites’ such as rātā or kamahi trees, leading to an even greater impact on these species.  … Possums were [also] filmed eating the eggs and chicks of kōkako …  They eat invertebrates, including weta, and are significant predators of New Zealand land snails such as Powelliphanta. They often occupy holes in tree trunks for their nests which would otherwise be used by nesting birds such as kākāriki and saddlebacks. …Researchers using nest-cameras have witnessed … kea nests invaded by stoats and possums in South Westland. ”\n\nHere it would seem possums can be defined as a ‘pest species’ that directly impacts the ecosystem, without any reference to human specific interests.\n\n### To recap\n\nVegans may still object to the term 'pest'. A species that is out-of-place in the eco-system is, in most cases, due to past meddling by humans and not a fault of the species. \n\nVegans can classify a species as problematic by reference to Leopold's non-speciesist definition. However, once identified, any action taken must *as far as is possible and practicable* be neither exploitive nor unnecessarily cruel.\n\n### Final thoughts \n\n\u003e Identifying a species as problematic does not commit a vegan to act in any specific manner. However, that vegans can offer a non-speciesist definition of 'pest' and can argue for a specific approach in dealing with them demonstrates that vegans can address complex environmental concerns.\n\nWhile the ideals of veganism are always placed first, individual vegans will differ on what, if any, actions ought to be taken. This can range from 'do nothing' (*all species have a right to life*) to 'controlling possums' (applying the golden rule of *acting to bring about the least harm*).\n\n*This is discussed in more depth in the appendix.*\n\nThis disagreement over 'how to act' is no different from individuals facing any difficult complex moral questions. Conflicts of opinion arise over euthanasia, abortion, freedom of speech, and many others.\n\n\n## Appendix.\n\n### Fitting all this into Moral Philosophy\n\nThe next section discusses ethical theory in some depth.  Dive in if you're interested, but it's the sort of stuff that causes some people to gnaw their own limbs off. (*I'm just kidding, honestly... it's safer than Vogon poetry.*)\n\nPerhaps, take a break and come back to it later. But If you do decide to skip this section the arguments above should be enough to serve you in your day-to-day discussions.\n\n\n### Back to the recap.\n\n1. Within a vegan ethic it is reasonable to classify a species as a pest by reference to a non-speciesist definition.  \n2. Even when a species is classified as a pest the principles of veganism require that they NOT be exploited or treated cruelly  \n3. Veganism is a moral standpoint so we should not expect it to prescribe a course of action. Rather, veganism limits how we might act (and certainly the manner in which we act).\n\n### So where to from here? \n\nWhile the ideals of veganism are always placed first, an individual vegan may embody any number of specific moral theories including, (but not limited to) rights based, utilitarianism, eco-feminism, egoism or virtue theory. A vegan may even take an eclectic approach and combine two or more of these moral theories. \n\nThis is no different to the environmentalist (or indeed any member of the human species) who all hold differing views about the nature of the good, and of right and wrong acts.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity we’ll look at just two positions; the rights-based vegan and the utilitarian vegan.\n\n### Rights-based vegan\n\n\u003e \"..all those individuals who are subjects-of-a-life ... have inherent value and thus enjoy an equal moral status.\"  \n\u003e - Tom Regan [The Case for Animal Rights](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009200412/https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/on-the-human/2011/05/regan-preface/)\n\n  \n\u003e \"...animals have one right--the right not to be treated as property.\"  \n\u003e - Gary Francione [Animals--Property or Persons?](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009200445/https://law.bepress.com/rutgersnewarklwps/art21/)\n\nThe ‘rights-based’ vegan may hold a position along the egalitarian lines of Tom Regan or the abolitionist position of Gary Francione. Those holding these or similar views might argue that we should not cull a pest species as we simply cannot, and should not, choose to eradicate one species to protect another. Other actions to protect the endangered species may be permissable but violating the possum’s *equal* right to life is not an option.\n\n### Utilitarian-based vegan\n\n\u003e \"If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering - in so far as rough comparisons can be made - of any other being.\"   \n\u003e - Peter Singer (1979) [Equality for Animals?](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009200532/https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1979----.htm)\n\nThe utilitarian vegan may adopt a position similar to Peter Singer *(considered by many the father of the modern animal rights movement)* and argue that the preferences *(interests)* of all affected must be considered equally.\n\nFor utilitarians consequences matter most and to *decide to do nothing* is to burden the responsibility for what follows. The consequence of doing  nothing in the possum scenario is the death (and possible extinction) of many other creatures; a consequence which for utilitarian-vegans seems intuitively wrong.\n\nUtilitarian-vegans might argue that where the eco-system is at risk, maximising preferences (and working towards a consequence that results in the least harm) requires controlling a pest species. \n\nThe ideal would be some form of biological contraception but, unfortunately, this is some years off. So, it would seem that for the utilitarian-vegan it is neither exploitive nor unnecessarily cruel to control (by culling) the possum population in the humanest way possible.\n\n*Please note that an extremely simplified version of rights based and utilitarian based ethics has been presented here.

Fine they are killed at the end of their lives, but they still get to live!\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e A world without animals being exploited by humans sounds like a wonderful world. Wild animals would continue to exist, we could even re-introduce breeds of wild sheep, cows, and pigs to the [vast areas of land]({{\u003c ref \"facts/land-usage\"\u003e}}) currently used for farming.  All the livestock that are alive today will be killed [within 18 months]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animal-life-expectancy\"\u003e}}) (barring dairy cows whose constant pregnancy goes on for up to 4 years). It is a cycle of oppression without end. Stop the next generation of animals being slaughtered, go vegan.\n\n## Detail\n\nThis argument is predicated on the idea that it's better to have a life than not, which seems intuitively compelling at first, if _wildly_ debatable considering some of the horrors of animal agriculture. But let's put that argument aside for a moment, because it has a hidden conclusion that:\n\n\u003e Because I'm giving a life to these animals in the first place, we can overlook the fact that I kill them for profit in [as little as 1.6% of their natural lifespan]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animal-life-expectancy\"\u003e}}).\n\nLet's take the lifespan of the animal destined to live the longest percentage of the natural lifespan, the dairy cow. They are [typically slaughtered at 4 years old]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animal-life-expectancy\"\u003e}}), which is 16-20% of their 15-20 natural year lifespan. In human terms (assuming an average lifespan of 80, which is generous), that would mean they would have been slaughtered at the age of 13-15. \n\nIt's hard to think of applying the same argument to some-one farming humans to the age of 13-15 years old. \"Oh but they have a good life while they're alive!\" rings false when life ends so abruptly and so early.\n\nForests could recover land from which they were lost, animals would actually flourish if the land dedicated to animal agriculture was left fallow. It's a more verdant, more diverse world that we would stand to see if animal agriculture came to an end.",

I don't want to be that awkward person at a party asking if everything is vegan! \n\nor \n\n\u003e I'm not going to ask my mum what's in her cooking and refuse to eat it if it's not vegan, she will crucify me!\n\n# Rebuttal  \n\n\u003e Awkwardness is part and parcel of standing up for what you believe in. If you're not willing to stand up for veganism, what other moral convictions will you cast aside when it becomes too awkward to express them? In order for our actions and morality to matter we've got to voice it when it's important. Otherwise you are just following whatever is socially acceptable rather than thinking critically about your opinions.\n\n## Detail\n\nThis was a big part of the reason that I was vegetarian for a year prior to going vegan. I felt there was a lot of stigma with the word vegan and didn't want to be associated with it. I didn't want to be mocked, and I didn't want to have to explain myself under the attention of numerous people. I was embarrassed. Eventually I realised a number of things:  \n\n1. Opting out of what I believed as a moral conviction because I was scared to associate with it was not the best version of myself. It was a betrayal of my core values.\n2. You get to choose how to act as a vegan. You can be as quiet or as loud as you like, you can be as compassionate or outraged at carnists as you like. Be the vegan you wish you had met. No-one can take your v-card away.\n3. The impression you have of veganism almost certainly comes from the most vocal/controversial portions of the community. If you don't identify with that, that's fine, there's the vast majority of the vegan community you haven't heard from.\n4. The outrage you see from the most controversial activists is very justified. If [70 billion]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animals-killed-annually\"\u003e}}) humans were being killed needlessly every year we would judge people who _weren't_ outraged.\n5. You don't have to approve of all actions of all other vegans. There is tonnes of internal debate and saying \"I don't agree with that\" is absolutely fine so long as you still don't use animal products!\n6. You being the vegan you want to see in the world is a chance to change people's mind about veganism, it is an act of activism in itself to share your form of compassion and discussion with other people, even on a very low-key level.\n\n# Advice \n\n## Family\nFamily in particular can be _really_ hard to tackle with veganism, in part because many families use food as an expression of love. If not handled carefully, even a highly-non-confrontational passing on a plate of food can come across as rejection of it as 'not good enough', which can make the parent in turn feel inadequate or rejected personally.  \n\nWhat you put in your body is **your choice**, however. You should never feel obliged to consume anything you don't feel comfortable with just to please some-one else. When approached with honesty and compassion, and crucially clarity that it is not a rejection of their cooking, of their love, or of them, an understanding can usually be found. A great way of dealing with it is offering to cook for your family in order to A) show them that vegan food is not just lettuce and grated carrots and B) that you are willing to put in the effort to show some goodwill.\n\n## Friends \u0026 Colleagues\nSocial situations can be tough in general, especially when you don't know the crowd's disposition towards veganism. Remember to take into account your own level of comfort with attention, and desire to talk about veganism when choosing your approach. It can be a great opportunity to talk about veganism with a new crowd, but you're no less vegan if you aren't comfortable with the spotlight on you and choose to fly under the radar as much as possible.\n\n",

Imagine how much higher that is when there is no oversight.\n\nIn all types of consumption in a 21st century society there is almost guaranteed to be some form of cruelty, and this must stop in all its forms. The difference with animal agriculture, however, is that stopping the cruelty without stopping the practice itself is impossible because the subject of the cruelty _is the product_. It's possible to imagine a world, campaign for a world, vote for a world, spend towards a world where the production of consumer goods and food does not involve the suffering of human beings (and we should!). But it is not possible to have a world where animal agriculture does not have suffering when animals are the product. Any business will try to maximise profits and minimise costs, often at the expense of the humans working for them, and this inherent opposition between profit and welfare will always see welfare lose out because animals cannot advocate for themselves. It is nearly impossible for a minimum wage worker who needs the income to blow the whistle on unsafe or inhumane working conditions without putting their family's livelihood in jeopardy. Animals are similarly silenced, unable to speak for themselves and tell a story even to those who will listen.\n",

Just because animals are not self-aware (sapient) does not give us the right to cause them suffering and death. \n\nThe famous quote from Jeremy Bentham is appropriate here: \n\n\u003e What else is it that should trace the insuperable line [between those afforded protection by the law and those that are not]? Is it the faculty of reason, or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? [T]he question is not, Can they reason? nor Can they talk? but Can they suffer?  \n\u003e  - Jeremy Bentham – An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation - 1789 - p311\n\n## Detail - Analytic \n\n### Sapience vs Sentience\n\nFirst let's clear up some common confusion around the world 'sentience'. \n\n\u003e A sentient being is capable of experiencing things through its senses.  \n\u003e - [Collins English Dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sentient)\n\nSo animals are clearly sentient because they have ears and eyes and noses through which to sense the world.\n\n\u003e [Sentience vs Sapience] is the distinction between being aware in the sense of being merely\nawake (which we share with nondiscursive animals - those that do not grasp concepts), on the one hand, and, on the other hand, being aware in a sense that involves knowledge either by being a kind of knowledge, or as potentially serving to justify judgments that so qualify.  \n\u003e - Robert Brandom's Study Guide to Wilfrid Sellars' Empricism and the Philosophy of Mind - Harvard University Press - 1997 - p121-122\n\nSapience is what most people are thinking of when they mean sentience. The ability to know things and reason with that knowledge.\n\n\n### Sapience Matters - Suffering is worse with sapience\n\n\u003e It's okay to eat animals because they are not sapient. The suffering of animals is less because they cannot anticipate their death, or understand that they are going to be slaughtered.  \n\nEven if this were true (it's not, animals at slaughterhouses know full well what's going to happen to them!) the idea that a hypothetical human's existential dread while being 'raised' for slaughter would be that much greater suffering than an animal's experience does not diminish the animal's suffering in any way. It is wrong to cause suffering, it is wrong to take someone's life away even if they are unable to anticipate it. \n\n# Sources\n\n- Robert Brandom's Study Guide to Wilfrid Sellars' Empricism and the Philosophy of Mind - Harvard University Press - 1997 \n- [Jeremy Bentham – An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation - 1789](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xqkSAQAAMAAJ\u0026dq=An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Principles%20of%20Morals%20and%20Legislation\u0026pg=PA311#v=onepage\u0026q\u0026f=false)",

This has already lead to the blossoming of vegan options in supermarkets around the world with companies rushing to take advantage of increasing vegan market.  \nEven if supply and demand didn't have an impact on companies production choices (e.g. milk subsidies in the US) we implicitly take a position on the morality of these industries by deciding whether or not we participate in them. Just because we cannot stop animal cruelty does not mean we should be part of it.\n\nThis fatalistic argument suggests that because an injustice is the status quo and there is no reasonable hope of ending it that we are morally justified in participating in it.  \n\n### Thought Experiment - Yulin Dog Festival\nLet's look at that through the lens of a different example, not even a terribly different one. Eating dogs.  \nAs a tourist to China you visit Yulin during the summer solstice, and visit the [Yulin Dog Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychee_and_Dog_Meat_Festival) where freshly cooked dog flesh is as available on the streets as pig and sheep flesh is all year round the world over.  \nUnder normal circumstances you (presumably) find the idea of killing and eating dogs morally abhorrent, do you suspend this value judgement and eat the dog meat in Yulin? If not, why not? No more or fewer dogs will be killed based on your decision.  \n\nIf the answer is \"because it's still wrong\" then you need to face that this is true of other animals as well, irrespective of whether or not you abstain from consuming them would result in a direct reduction of suffering.  \n\nIf the answer is \"Because I find it personally uncomfortable but I would be okay with it otherwise\" then we're getting down to the core of the issue. Why are you okay with eating dog abstractly if you believe killing dogs for food is wrong? \"There's no negative consequence to eating the dog once it's already dead. Why not eat it if you want to?\"\n\nIn the Yulin dog festival scenario there are two things wrong with this:\n\n1. You will be supporting the industry by paying for the meal, that money goes back into next year's festival to breed more dogs for slaughter.\n2. There is a disconnect here between the ethics of your actions and the ethics of the consequences of your actions.\n\n### Thought Experiment - Dead Body at the Side of the Road\nLet's look at the aforementioned ethical disconnect between actions and consequences through the light of another thought experiment.  \n\nSuppose you find a body on the side of the road, killed by a hit and run. Rather morbidly you rifle through the journal you find in their pocket learning they are entirely alone in this world and unmissed by anyone. You are miles away from any jurisdiction, on a disused logging road deep in the forest, the police will never find the body.  \nIs it ethical to eat the body?  \n\nMost people will be repulsed by the question and say of course it isn't ethical, how could it be? Eating people is inherently wrong, unlike animals.  \nBut what is the difference between this scenario and the Yulin dog scenario? If anything this scenario is _more_ clear from negative consequences because you're not providing monetary support to the person who did the killing, and therefore are not contributing to the likelihood that more people will be killed. \n\nThe difference is that you've successfully internalised that eating people is wrong irrespective of the circumstances, and are therefore unwilling to eat people _even_ if it doesn't make a difference to how likely it is for more people to die.  \n\nIt is this internalisation of rightness or wrongness that most vegans hinge on when they make the decision not to consume animal products. It's not _even about_ whether or not an individual can make a difference (hint they can, influentially, in aggregate, and over time), it's about whether the action is fundamentally right or wrong.\n\nIt is, at its core, about the fact that an animal had to die in order for you to be able to eat them.\n\n## Detail - Analytic - Monetary Support\n\nThe second problem with saying \"it's okay to eat a dog in the Yulin dog festival\" when you disagree with the concept of killing dogs for food, is that irrespective of whether your purchasing the dog meat makes the dog any less dead, that purchasing decision _is_ the demand that business owners take into account when they make stock decisions. \n\nYour money from purchasing the dog meat will go towards breeding more dogs for next year's festival, and even if the amount you pay is paltry, it has to be considered in aggregate. If every tourist supports the dog meat industry, it will grow to accommodate that demand. If none of them do, it will shrink accordingly. \n\n## Detail - Motive - Impact of Individual's Actions - All Actions are Activism in an Oppressive System\n\nAll political movements engaged with righting a wrong throughout history have been composed of individuals. Without individuals there is no movement, and every action you take in service of animal liberation is an act of resistance against the status quo. The waiter whom you ask for the vegan option, might just think 'huh, so many people are ordering that these days, I should check it out'. Your conversation with your friend might plant the seed of receptivity to veganism, and they might inspire others in turn to go vegan. The animal rights march you take part in might be the biggest ever and make the news. You might inspire, or get inspired through activism to be, a driving force in the animal rights movement.  \n\nEvery action, no matter how small, matters. You don't have to boil the ocean, you just have to make a splash.\n\nWhatever you do, just don't forget, veganism is not for vegans.  \n\n**Veganism is for the animals.**",

Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, *as far as is possible and practicable*, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals [...].

The reality is that vegans (being human) are typically not perfect. Vegans are subject to the constraints of time, money, knowledge, availability of resources, and a million other factors. \n\nThat a vegan may fail in no way invalidates the moral claim that the exploitation of animals is wrong.\n\n\u003e Argument #1 is a fallacy (the appeal to hypocrisy).\n\n### Argument #2 *Intent \u0026 Knowledge*\n\nVegans must eat and, where there are limited options, follow the path of least harm.\n\n\n\u003eA golden rule of moral philosophy is, \"all things being equal you ought to choose the action that does the least harm”.\n\nWhile it is true that some animals do die in the production and harvesting of crops vegans do not ‘accept these deaths’ without question.  Where a crop farmer fails to *exercise due diligence to minimize the harm* and deaths occur, an obligation falls on vegans *as far as is possible and practicable* to seek alternatives (e.g. moving towards organic vegetables, buying from [vegan farms](https://www.viva.org.uk/what-we-do/vegan-farming), avoiding mono-cultures etc.)\n\n\u003e ### Doctrine of Double Effect\n\u003e - the nature of the act is itself good, or at least morally neutral;  \n\u003e - the individual intends the good effect and does not intend the bad effect, either as a means to the good or as an end in itself;  \n\u003e - the good effect outweighs the bad effect in circumstances sufficiently grave to justify causing the bad effect, and the individual exercises due diligence to minimize the harm.  \n\u003e \n\u003e *from* Double-Effect Reasoning: Doing Good and Avoiding Evil *by* T. A. Cavanaugh.\n \nIn other words a cattle farmer *intends* to kill the cattle, the crop farmer's intention is primarily to grow crops. Any deaths that may occur during crop harvest are a side-effect of a morally neutral act. \n\n- A counter might follow that 'regardless of intention or acceptance the animals die, so I might as well get my meat.'\n\nThis counter argument fails to take into account an individual's knowledge of what will occur.\n\n* A cattle farmer knows that the cattle will be slaughtered and intends for them to be slaughtered.\n\n* A crop farmer knows that some animals (e.g rabbits, birds, rodents) may be killed during harvest but the intention is only to harvest crops. (The crop farmer would far prefer the animals were not in the field).\n \nConsider the following thought experiment:\n\n\u003e You are controlling a tram. As long as you hold a lever the tram will continue on its current track.  However, you know there are people on the track ahead who will be killed if the tram continues.  \n\u003e If you release the lever the tram will change tracks. You suspect there are people on the other track as well.\n\n1. Continuing to hold the lever is to kill with both certainty and intent.\n\n2. Releasing the lever is to know that some people *might* be killed.\n\nKnowingly risking some deaths is morally preferable to killing with certainty and intent.\n\nHumans hold a lever which results in the intentional deaths of millions of animals. It's time to let go of the lever; the knowledge that some animals will probably die as a result of crop farming is not an argument against veganism.\n\n\u003e Vegans do not accept the deaths of some animals to produce our foods of preference. While vegans know this may occur it is not the intent and, wherever possible, steps are taken to reduce and mitigate this harm. \n\u003e \n\u003e  There is considerable moral difference between slaughtering animals with intent and deaths that occur as an unintentional side effect of crop farming, even where we know the deaths might occur. \n\n\n### Argument #3 *Definition of Veganism*\n\nThe definition of veganism is in our Quick Response but it's so important it's worth repeating: \n\n\u003e Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.  \n\u003e - [The Vegan Society - Definition of Veganism](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism)\n\nThe claim that ‘veganism is logically impossible' misrepresents the nature of veganism. As with any moral standpoint perfection is not expected. Rather, vegans strive toward the ideal of a world without exploitation and cruelty. However, it is necessary to recognise that it is nearly impossible to exist without cruelty to animals or people while still participating in a 21st century society, and to forgive ourselves for the things we cannot avoid. \n\nTo exist, as far as is possible and practicable*, without exploitation of, or cruelty to, animals is both logical and possible.\n\n#### * What does *possible and practicable* mean?\n\nThis is not an excuse to have a steak when there isn't a vegan option at the restaurant. Eating a boring salad is a very minor discomfort by comparison with the horrors that animals face in slaughterhouses. \n\nNor is it an excuse to not learn those pesky [E-numbers]({{\u003c ref \"/shopping/e-numbers\" \u003e}}). The mistreatment of animals does not compare to committing these to memory, or carrying around the TalkVeganToMe App.\n\n\n\n\u003e *Possible and practicable* is NOT a line vegans draw for themselves to mitigate some perceived inconvenience. it is a reference to the threshold a ‘rational person’ would set; ‘all other things being equal’. \n\nThis appeal to a rational person is not an excuse to gatekeep veganism by arguing against other peoples' decisions. Remember you do not have all the facts when someone relays a story about a time they had to make a difficult decision.\n\nMoral decisions are not arbitrary, but neither is it your role to act as jury for other people's decisions. The 'rational person' clause simply provides a medium for academic discussions regarding veganism.\n\nNo-one can take your v-card away, and you cannot take anyone else's away either.\n",

We are just animals ourselves, it's natural.\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e Animals do eat other animals, but animals are not who we look to for examples of moral behaviour. We wouldn't say it's okay to kill members of our own species because animals do it. Or rape one another because animals do it. Just because something is 'natural' does not make it right.\n\n## Detail - Analytic\n\nThis is a classic example of the Appeal to Nature Fallacy\n\n\u003e [The Appeal to Nature Fallacy] is the belief that what is natural must be good [...] and that which is unnatural must be bad [...].\n\u003e - Logically Fallacious - Bo Bennet - 2012\n\nEarthquakes are natural, pain is natural, our own death is natural, but just because they are natural does not mean that they are good. Cars are 'unnatural', pain relief is unnatural, food standards and sanitation are unnatural, but that does not mean they are bad.  \n\n## Detail - Emotive\n\nTied up in this argument is often the idea that vegans are 'disconnected from the harsh realities of the world' or 'too weak to do what's necessary'. The actual fact is that veganism stems from a _very real_ understanding of what it means to eat meat. Vegan documentaries are full of footage from slaughterhouses and factory farms, places that people who eat meat typically never see let alone visit. \n\nIt is hard to imagine anything more 'disconnected from the harsh realities of the world' than taking a plastic package of meat and consuming it without ever having even _thought_ of the animal which it came from.\n\n\n",

It is not a necessary need to eat meat.\n2. Eating meat is the indirect cause of great harm.\n3. The golden rule that, \"all things being equal you ought to choose the action that does the least harm”\n\nwill necessarily conclude:\n\n- Your _personal choice_ to eat meat causes unnecessary harm, does not warrant respect, and morally obligates me to speak out.\n\n \n\u003e Point 1 is a factual claim. If you doubt this claim please read [A well planned vegan diet is suitable for people of all ages.]({{\u003c ref \"/facts/suitable-for-all\" \u003e}})\n\n\u003e Point 2 is the factual claim that animals are harmed by commercial farming and slaughter. See [Animal slaughter methods]({{\u003c ref \"/facts/animal-slaughter-methods\" \u003e}})\n\n\u003e Point 3 is a *value statement*  that most people would accept.\n\nThe conclusion holds that, where an individual could *easily choose otherwise* but instead *out of personal choice* selects an option that does uneccessary harm, there is no reason to respect that individual's choice and there is good reason to speak out against it.\n\nThis holds equally true:\n\n- If you choose to litter.\n- If you choose to buy clothes knowing they were made in a sweat shop when you have other options.\n\n\u003e So yes; it's your personal choice.
