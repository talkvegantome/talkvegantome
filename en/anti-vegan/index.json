          "rawContent": "\n# Argument\n\n\u003e Veganism is often criticised for failing to adequately address specific environmental concerns; such as pest control.\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e Environmental Ethics is complex and difficult. Even assuming we can reach agreement on the definition of pest it does not automatically follow that humans *ought* to control or eradicate any species.\n\nor\n\n\u003e While the ideals of veganism are always placed first, individual vegans will differ on what, if any, actions ought to be taken. This can range from 'do nothing' (*all species have a right to life*) to 'controlling possums' (applying the golden rule of *acting to bring about the least harm*)\n\n  \n## Detail - Analytic\n\nIt is difficult to interpret how the central principle of veganism *‘avoid exploitation of and cruelty to animals'* might be applied in complex environmental considerations. \n\nHowever, before we try, a few concepts require unpacking.\n\n### 1. Veganism is a moral standpoint. \n\n\nVeganism is not a moral theory.  Veganism is a moral standpoint regarding the (mis)treatment of animals by (most) humans, either directly or by passive acceptance. We can’t expect specific moral standpoints to offer complete answers to questions that are fully or partially outside their scope.  That said, there is considerable crossover between environmental and animal concerns so intuitively we expect that vegans ought to hold a position on environmental issues\n\n### 2. What is a pest?\n\nPest is commonly defined along the lines of any “small animal which damages crops or food supplies” ([Collins](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009200032/https://www.dictionary.com/browse/pest)) or “any animal or plant detrimental to human concerns” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(organism))).  \n\n\u003e Speciesism is a form of discrimination based on species membership. It involves treating members of one species as morally more important than members of other species even when their interests are equivalent.  \n\u003e  - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism)\n\nVegans will NOT accept this definition of pest as it is 'speciesist’. That an animal’s interests conflict with human interests is not, in itself, a reason for defining the animal as a pest or for taking action against them. Where crops are concerned alternative means such as fencing, sonics, and eco-friendly organic practices are available.  \n\n## Re-defining ‘pest’.\n\n\u003e \"A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.”  \n\u003e - Aldo Leopold (1949) [The Land Ethic](http://web.archive.org/web/20191009200336/https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil3140/Leopold.pdf) \n\nAldo Leopold, the father of environmental ethics, provides a non-speciesist means to identify problematic species in \"The Land Ethic\". A species is problematic (a 'pest') when, regardless of human interest, it upsets the stability of, interrupts the integrity of, or leads to the destruction of the environment.  \n\nTwo New Zealand specific examples:\n\n### Are wild rabbits a pest?\n\n[Biosecurity NZ](http://web.archive.org/web/20191007214252/https://www.mpi.govt.nz/protection-and-response/long-term-pest-management/wild-rabbits/) lists rabbits as pests because they ‘compete with livestock, cause extensive damage to farming land, cause public nuisance...'\n\nSo, yes, they are annoying to (some) humans but they are not a ‘pest’. The reasons provided by Biosecurity NZ fail under Leopold’s criteria. If wild rabbits are a pest other more substantial, non-speciesist, reasons must be provided.\n\n### Are possums a pest?\n\nPossums occur in high numbers in NZ, breed fast and face very few predators. Without doubt possums have a major impact on New Zealands native ecosystems.\n\n[Department of Conservation NZ](https://web.archive.org/web/20190227050251/https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/pests-and-threats/animal-pests/possums/) lists possums as pests, as, “Leaves are the main part of their diet, but possums are opportunistic omnivores. They eat buds, flowers, fruit/berries and nectar, which means they compete with native birds and reptiles for food sources. The growth and life-cycle of a tree or plant is significantly affected when all parts of it are eaten. Possums also have ‘favourites’ such as rātā or kamahi trees, leading to an even greater impact on these species.  … Possums were [also] filmed eating the eggs and chicks of kōkako …  They eat invertebrates, including weta, and are significant predators of New Zealand land snails such as Powelliphanta. They often occupy holes in tree trunks for their nests which would otherwise be used by nesting birds such as kākāriki and saddlebacks. …Researchers using nest-cameras have witnessed … kea nests invaded by stoats and possums in South Westland. ”\n\nHere it would seem possums can be defined as a ‘pest species’ that directly impacts the ecosystem, without any reference to human specific interests.\n\n### To recap\n\nVegans may still object to the term 'pest'. A species that is out-of-place in the eco-system is, in most cases, due to past meddling by humans and not a fault of the species. \n\nVegans can classify a species as problematic by reference to Leopold's non-speciesist definition. However, once identified, any action taken must *as far as is possible and practicable* be neither exploitive nor unnecessarily cruel.\n\n### Final thoughts \n\n\u003e Identifying a species as problematic does not commit a vegan to act in any specific manner. However, that vegans can offer a non-speciesist definition of 'pest' and can argue for a specific approach in dealing with them demonstrates that vegans can address complex environmental concerns.\n\nWhile the ideals of veganism are always placed first, individual vegans will differ on what, if any, actions ought to be taken. This can range from 'do nothing' (*all species have a right to life*) to 'controlling possums' (applying the golden rule of *acting to bring about the least harm*).\n\n*This is discussed in more depth in the appendix.*\n\nThis disagreement over 'how to act' is no different from individuals facing any difficult complex moral questions. Conflicts of opinion arise over euthanasia, abortion, freedom of speech, and many others.\n\n\n## Appendix.\n\n### Fitting all this into Ethical Philosophical\n\nThe next section discusses ethical theory in some depth.  Dive in if you're interested, but it's the sort of stuff that causes some people to gnaw their own limbs off.\n\nIf you decide to skip this section the arguments above should be enough to serve you in your day-to-day discussions.\n\n\n### Back to the recap.\n\n1. Within a vegan ethic it is reasonable to classify a species as a pest by reference to a non-speciesist definition.  \n2. Even when a species is classified as a pest the principles of veganism require that they NOT be exploited or treated cruelly  \n3. Veganism is a moral standpoint so we should not expect it to prescribe a course of action. Rather, veganism limits how we might act (and certainly the manner in which we act).\n\n### So where to from here? \n\nWhile the ideals of veganism are always placed first, an individual vegan may embody any number of specific moral theories including, (but not limited to) rights based, utilitarianism, eco-feminism, egoism or virtue theory. A vegan may even take an eclectic approach and combine two or more of these moral theories. \n\nThis is no different to the environmentalist (or indeed any member of the human species) who all hold differing views about the nature of the good, and of right and wrong acts.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity we’ll look at just two positions; the rights-based vegan and the utilitarian vegan.\n\n### Rights-based vegan\n\n\u003e \"..all those individuals who are subjects-of-a-life ... have inherent value and thus enjoy an equal moral status.\"  \n\u003e - Tom Regan [The Case for Animal Rights](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009200412/https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/on-the-human/2011/05/regan-preface/)\n\n  \n\u003e \"...animals have one right--the right not to be treated as property.\"  \n\u003e - Gary Francione [Animals--Property or Persons?](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009200445/https://law.bepress.com/rutgersnewarklwps/art21/)\n\nThe ‘rights-based’ vegan may hold a position along the egalitarian lines of Tom Regan or the abolitionist position of Gary Francione. Those holding these or similar views might argue that we should not cull a pest species as we simply cannot, and should not, choose to eradicate one species to protect another. Other actions to protect the endangered species may be permissable but violating the possum’s *equal* right to life is not an option.\n\n### Utilitarian-based vegan\n\n\u003e \"If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering - in so far as rough comparisons can be made - of any other being.\"   \n\u003e - Peter Singer (1979) [Equality for Animals?](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009200532/https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1979----.htm)\n\nThe utilitarian vegan may adopt a position similar to Peter Singer *(considered by many the father of the modern animal rights movement)* and argue that the preferences *(interests)* of all affected must be considered equally.\n\nFor utilitarians consequences matter most and to *decide to do nothing* is to burden the responsibility for what follows. The consequence of doing  nothing in the possum scenario is the death (and possible extinction) of many other creatures; a consequence which for utilitarian-vegans seems intuitively wrong.\n\nUtilitarian-vegans might argue that where the eco-system is at risk, maximising preferences (and working towards a consequence that results in the least harm) requires controlling a pest species. \n\nThe ideal would be some form of biological contraception but, unfortunately, this is some years off. So, it would seem that for the utilitarian-vegan it is neither exploitive nor unnecessarily cruel to control (by culling) the possum population in the humanest way possible.\n\n*Please note that an extremely simplified version of rights based and utilitarian based ethics has been presented here.

Fine they are killed at the end of their lives, but they still get to live!\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e A world without animals being exploited by humans sounds like a wonderful world. Wild animals would continue to exist, we could even re-introduce breeds of wild sheep, cows, and pigs to the [vast areas of land]({{\u003c ref \"facts/land-usage\"\u003e}}) currently used for farming.  All the livestock that are alive today will be killed [within 18 months]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animal-life-expectancy\"\u003e}}) (barring dairy cows whose constant pregnancy goes on for up to 4 years). It is a cycle of oppression without end. Stop the next generation of animals being slaughtered, go vegan.\n\n## Detail\n\nThis argument is predicated on the idea that it's better to have a life than not, which seems intuitively compelling at first, if _wildly_ debatable considering some of the horrors of animal agriculture. But let's put that argument aside for a moment, because it has a hidden conclusion that:\n\n\u003e Because I'm giving a life to these animals in the first place, we can overlook the fact that I kill them for profit in [as little as 1.6% of their natural lifespan]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animal-life-expectancy\"\u003e}}).\n\nLet's take the lifespan of the animal destined to live the longest percentage of the natural lifespan, the dairy cow. They are [typically slaughtered at 4 years old]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animal-life-expectancy\"\u003e}}), which is 16-20% of their 15-20 natural year lifespan. In human terms (assuming an average lifespan of 80, which is generous), that would mean they would have been slaughtered at the age of 13-15. \n\nIt's hard to think of applying the same argument to some-one farming humans to the age of 13-15 years old. \"Oh but they have a good life while they're alive!\" rings false when life ends so abruptly and so early.\n\nForests could recover land from which they were lost, animals would actually flourish if the land dedicated to animal agriculture was left fallow. It's a more verdant, more diverse world that we would stand to see if animal agriculture came to an end.",

I don't want to be that awkward person at a party asking if everything is vegan! \n\nor \n\n\u003e I'm not going to ask my mum what's in her cooking and refuse to eat it if it's not vegan, she will crucify me!\n\n# Rebuttal  \n\n\u003e Awkwardness is part and parcel of standing up for what you believe in. If you're not willing to stand up for veganism, what other moral convictions will you cast aside when it becomes too awkward to express them? In order for our actions and morality to matter we've got to voice it when it's important. Otherwise you are just following whatever is socially acceptable rather than thinking critically about your opinions.\n\n## Detail\n\nThis was a big part of the reason that I was vegetarian for a year prior to going vegan. I felt there was a lot of stigma with the word vegan and didn't want to be associated with it. I didn't want to be mocked, and I didn't want to have to explain myself under the attention of numerous people. I was embarrassed. Eventually I realised a number of things:  \n\n1. Opting out of what I believed as a moral conviction because I was scared to associate with it was not the best version of myself. It was a betrayal of my core values.\n2. You get to choose how to act as a vegan. You can be as quiet or as loud as you like, you can be as compassionate or outraged at carnists as you like. Be the vegan you wish you had met. No-one can take your v-card away.\n3. The impression you have of veganism almost certainly comes from the most vocal/controversial portions of the community. If you don't identify with that, that's fine, there's the vast majority of the vegan community you haven't heard from.\n4. The outrage you see from the most controversial activists is very justified. If [70 billion]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animals-killed-annually\"\u003e}}) humans were being killed needlessly every year we would judge people who _weren't_ outraged.\n5. You don't have to approve of all actions of all other vegans. There is tonnes of internal debate and saying \"I don't agree with that\" is absolutely fine so long as you still don't use animal products!\n6. You being the vegan you want to see in the world is a chance to change people's mind about veganism, it is an act of activism in itself to share your form of compassion and discussion with other people, even on a very low-key level.\n\n# Advice \n\n## Family\nFamily in particular can be _really_ hard to tackle with veganism, in part because many families use food as an expression of love. If not handled carefully, even a highly-non-confrontational passing on a plate of food can come across as rejection of it as 'not good enough', which can make the parent in turn feel inadequate or rejected personally.  \n\nWhat you put in your body is **your choice**, however. You should never feel obliged to consume anything you don't feel comfortable with just to please some-one else. When approached with honesty and compassion, and crucially clarity that it is not a rejection of their cooking, of their love, or of them, an understanding can usually be found. A great way of dealing with it is offering to cook for your family in order to A) show them that vegan food is not just lettuce and grated carrots and B) that you are willing to put in the effort to show some goodwill.\n\n## Friends \u0026 Colleagues\nSocial situations can be tough in general, especially when you don't know the crowd's disposition towards veganism. Remember to take into account your own level of comfort with attention, and desire to talk about veganism when choosing your approach. It can be a great opportunity to talk about veganism with a new crowd, but you're no less vegan if you aren't comfortable with the spotlight on you and choose to fly under the radar as much as possible.\n\n",

Imagine how much higher that is when there is no oversight.\n\nIn all types of consumption in a 21st century society there is almost guaranteed to be some form of cruelty, and this must stop in all its forms. The difference with animal agriculture, however, is that stopping the cruelty without stopping the practice itself is impossible because the subject of the cruelty _is the product_. It's possible to imagine a world, campaign for a world, vote for a world, spend towards a world where the production of consumer goods and food does not involve the suffering of human beings (and we should!). But it is not possible to have a world where animal agriculture does not have suffering when animals are the product. Any business will try to maximise profits and minimise costs, often at the expense of the humans working for them, and this inherent opposition between profit and welfare will always see welfare lose out because animals cannot advocate for themselves. It is nearly impossible for a minimum wage worker who needs the income to blow the whistle on unsafe or inhumane working conditions without putting their family's livelihood in jeopardy. Animals are similarly silenced, unable to speak for themselves and tell a story even to those who will listen.\n",

Just because animals are not self-aware (sapient) does not give us the right to cause them suffering and death. \n\nThe famous quote from Jeremy Bentham is appropriate here: \n\n\u003e What else is it that should trace the insuperable line [between those afforded protection by the law and those that are not]? Is it the faculty of reason, or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? [T]he question is not, Can they reason? nor Can they talk? but Can they suffer?  \n\u003e  - Jeremy Bentham – An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation - 1789 - p311\n\n## Detail - Analytic \n\n### Sapience vs Sentience\n\nFirst let's clear up some common confusion around the world 'sentience'. \n\n\u003e A sentient being is capable of experiencing things through its senses.  \n\u003e - [Collins English Dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sentient)\n\nSo animals are clearly sentient because they have ears and eyes and noses through which to sense the world.\n\n\u003e [Sentience vs Sapience] is the distinction between being aware in the sense of being merely\nawake (which we share with nondiscursive animals - those that do not grasp concepts), on the one hand, and, on the other hand, being aware in a sense that involves knowledge either by being a kind of knowledge, or as potentially serving to justify judgments that so qualify.  \n\u003e - Robert Brandom's Study Guide to Wilfrid Sellars' Empricism and the Philosophy of Mind - Harvard University Press - 1997 - p121-122\n\nSapience is what most people are thinking of when they mean sentience. The ability to know things and reason with that knowledge.\n\n\n### Sapience Matters - Suffering is worse with sapience\n\n\u003e It's okay to eat animals because they are not sapient. The suffering of animals is less because they cannot anticipate their death, or understand that they are going to be slaughtered.  \n\nEven if this were true (it's not, animals at slaughterhouses know full well what's going to happen to them!) the idea that a hypothetical human's existential dread while being 'raised' for slaughter would be that much greater suffering than an animal's experience does not diminish the animal's suffering in any way. It is wrong to cause suffering, it is wrong to take someone's life away even if they are unable to anticipate it. \n\n# Sources\n\n- Robert Brandom's Study Guide to Wilfrid Sellars' Empricism and the Philosophy of Mind - Harvard University Press - 1997 \n- [Jeremy Bentham – An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation - 1789](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xqkSAQAAMAAJ\u0026dq=An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Principles%20of%20Morals%20and%20Legislation\u0026pg=PA311#v=onepage\u0026q\u0026f=false)",

Just because we cannot stop animal cruelty does not mean we should be part of it.\n\nThis fatalistic argument suggests that because an injustice is the status quo and there is no reasonable hope of ending it that we are morally justified in participating in it.  \n\n### Thought Experiment - Yulin Dog Festival\nLet's look at that through the lens of a different example, not even a terribly different one. Eating dogs.  \nAs a tourist to China you visit Yulin during the summer solstice, and visit the [Yulin Dog Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychee_and_Dog_Meat_Festival) where freshly cooked dog flesh is as available on the streets as pig and sheep flesh is all year round the world over.  \nUnder normal circumstances you (presumably) find the idea of killing and eating dogs morally abhorrent, do you suspend this value judgement and eat the dog meat in Yulin? If not, why not? No more or fewer dogs will be killed based on your decision.  \n\nIf the answer is \"because it's still wrong\" then you need to face that this is true of other animals as well, irrespective of whether or not you abstain from consuming them would result in a direct reduction of suffering.  \n\nIf the answer is \"Because I find it personally uncomfortable but I would be okay with it otherwise\" then we're getting down to the core of the issue. Why are you okay with eating dog abstractly if you believe killing dogs for food is wrong? \"There's no negative consequence to eating the dog once it's already dead. Why not eat it if you want to?\"\n\nIn the Yulin dog festival scenario there are two things wrong with this:\n\n1. You will be supporting the industry by paying for the meal, that money goes back into next year's festival to breed more dogs for slaughter.\n2. There is a disconnect here between the ethics of your actions and the ethics of the consequences of your actions.\n\n### Thought Experiment - Dead Body at the Side of the Road\nLet's look at the aforementioned ethical disconnect between actions and consequences through the light of another thought experiment.  \n\nSuppose you find a body on the side of the road, killed by a hit and run. Rather morbidly you rifle through the journal you find in their pocket learning they are entirely alone in this world and unmissed by anyone. You are miles away from any jurisdiction, on a disused logging road deep in the forest, the police will never find the body.  \nIs it ethical to eat the body?  \n\nMost people will be repulsed by the question and say of course it isn't ethical, how could it be? Eating people is inherently wrong, unlike animals.  \nBut what is the difference between this scenario and the Yulin dog scenario? If anything this scenario is _more_ clear from negative consequences because you're not providing monetary support to the person who did the killing, and therefore are not contributing to the likelihood that more people will be killed. \n\nThe difference is that you've successfully internalised that eating people is wrong irrespective of the circumstances, and are therefore unwilling to eat people _even_ if it doesn't make a difference to how likely it is for more people to die.  \n\nIt is this internalisation of rightness or wrongness that most vegans hinge on when they make the decision not to consume animal products. It's not _even about_ whether or not an individual can make a difference (hint they can, influentially, in aggregate, and over time), it's about whether the action is fundamentally right or wrong.\n\nIt is, at its core, about the fact that an animal had to die in order for you to be able to eat them.\n\n## Detail - Analytic - Monetary Support\n\nThe second problem with saying \"it's okay to eat a dog in the Yulin dog festival\" when you disagree with the concept of killing dogs for food, is that irrespective of whether your purchasing the dog meat makes the dog any less dead, that purchasing decision _is_ the demand that business owners take into account when they make stock decisions. \n\nYour money from purchasing the dog meat will go towards breeding more dogs for next year's festival, and even if the amount you pay is paltry, it has to be considered in aggregate. If every tourist supports the dog meat industry, it will grow to accommodate that demand. If none of them do, it will shrink accordingly. \n\n## Detail - Motive - Impact of Individual's Actions - All Actions are Activism in an Oppressive System\n\nAll political movements engaged with righting a wrong throughout history have been composed of individuals. Without individuals there is no movement, and every action you take in service of animal liberation is an act of resistance against the status quo. The waiter whom you ask for the vegan option, might just think 'huh, so many people are ordering that these days, I should check it out'. Your conversation with your friend might plant the seed of receptivity to veganism, and they might inspire others in turn to go vegan. The animal rights march you take part in might be the biggest ever and make the news. You might inspire, or get inspired through activism to be, a driving force in the animal rights movement.  \n\nEvery action, no matter how small, matters. You don't have to boil the ocean, you just have to make a splash.\n\nWhatever you do, just don't forget, veganism is not for vegans.  \n\n**Veganism is for the animals.**",

          "rawContent": "\n# Argument\n\n\u003e It's impossible to have completely vegan food. Fertilizers are derived from animal waste and bones, pesticides are used on crops to kill insects, bees are kept in portable hives to pollinate almonds, worms are killed by tilling fields. All food involves death.\n\nThis can be unpacked as three different arguments:\n\n1. You eat foods that are not completely vegan therefore your claim that animal exploitation is morally wrong is false.\n\n2. You accept the deaths of some animals to produce your foods of preference. This is morally indistinguishable from the deaths that occur to produce my foods of preference.\n\n3. Veganism is logically impossible - it is impossible to produce food without exploiting animals. \n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Responses\n\n#### (Argument #1) \n\u003e This argument is an appeal to hypocrisy (*the Tu quoque fallacy*). That I fail to meet my own standards is nothing more than a personal failure and does not invalidate my principles. My failure to pick up a piece of litter that I've dropped does not invalidate my claim that littering is wrong. That I may fall short and in some way be complicit in an animal's death in no way invalidates the moral claim that the exploitation of animals is wrong.\n\u003e\n\n#### (Argument #2)\n\u003e  \"It is wrong to inflict unnecessary death on nonhuman animals and it is especially wrong ... to do so intentionally. Where one must choose between bringing about death as a side-effect, one should, all else equal, pursue the latter course of action\".  \n\u003e - The Intentional Killing of Field Animals and Ethical Veganism *by*  Joe Wills\n\n#### (Argument #3) \n\u003e \"While not logically impossible, it is *almost impossible* to avoid being complicit in suffering with our current food chain. Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, *as far as is possible and practicable*, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals [...]. Raising an animal from forcible impregnation to their untimely death merely to satisfy our desire for taste is not comparable to deaths we have little way of avoiding as consumers.\"  \n\u003e - Definition of veganism verbatim from [The Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism)\n\n## Detail - Analytic\n\n### Argument #1 *Moral Consistency*\n\nTrying to trip vegans up by exposing real or imagined inconsistencies is common rhetoric. The reality is that vegans (being human) are typically not perfect. Vegans are subject to the constraints of time, money, knowledge, availability of resources, and a million other factors. \n\nThat a vegan may fail in no way invalidates the moral claim that the exploitation of animals is wrong.\n\n\u003e Argument #1 is a fallacy (the appeal to hypocrisy).\n\n### Argument #2 *Intent \u0026 Knowledge*\n\nVegans must eat and, where there are limited options, follow the path of least harm.\n\n\n\u003eA golden rule of moral philosophy is, \"all things being equal you ought to choose the action that does the least harm”.\n\nWhile it is true that some animals do die in the production and harvesting of crops vegans do not ‘accept these deaths’ without question.  Where a crop farmer fails to *exercise due diligence to minimize the harm* and deaths occur, an obligation falls on vegans *as far as is possible and practicable* to seek alternatives (e.g. moving towards organic vegetables, buying from [vegan farms](https://www.viva.org.uk/what-we-do/vegan-farming), avoiding mono-cultures etc.)\n\n\u003e ### Doctrine of Double Effect\n\u003e - the nature of the act is itself good, or at least morally neutral;  \n\u003e - the individual intends the good effect and does not intend the bad effect, either as a means to the good or as an end in itself;  \n\u003e - the good effect outweighs the bad effect in circumstances sufficiently grave to justify causing the bad effect, and the individual exercises due diligence to minimize the harm.  \n\u003e \n\u003e *from* Double-Effect Reasoning: Doing Good and Avoiding Evil *by* T. A. Cavanaugh.\n \nIn other words a cattle farmer *intends* to kill the cattle, the crop farmer's intention is primarily to grow crops. Any deaths that may occur during crop harvest are a side-effect of a morally neutral act. \n\n- A counter might follow that 'regardless of intention or acceptance the animals die, so I might as well get my meat.'\n\nThis counter argument fails to take into account an individual's knowledge of what will occur.\n\n* A cattle farmer knows that the cattle will be slaughtered and intends for them to be slaughtered.\n\n* A crop farmer knows that some animals (e.g rabbits, birds, rodents) may be killed during harvest but the intention is only to harvest crops. (The crop farmer would far prefer the animals were not in the field).\n \nConsider the following thought experiment:\n\n\u003e You are controlling a tram. As long as you hold a lever the tram will continue on its current track.  However, you know there are people on the track ahead who will be killed if the tram continues.  \n\u003e If you release the lever the tram will change tracks. You suspect there are people on the other track as well.\n\n1. Continuing to hold the lever is to kill with both certainty and intent.\n\n2. Releasing the lever is to know that some people *might* be killed.\n\nKnowingly risking some deaths is morally preferable to killing with certainty and intent.\n\nHumans hold a lever which results in the intentional deaths of millions of animals. It's time to let go of the lever; the knowledge that some animals will probably die as a result of crop farming is not an argument against veganism.\n\n\u003e Vegans do not accept the deaths of some animals to produce our foods of preference. While vegans know this may occur it is not the intent and, wherever possible, steps are taken to reduce and mitigate this harm. \n\u003e \n\u003e  There is considerable moral difference between slaughtering animals with intent and deaths that occur as an unintentional side effect of crop farming, even where we know the deaths might occur. \n\n\n### Argument #3 *Definition of Veganism*\n\nThe definition of veganism is in our Quick Response but it's so important it's worth repeating: \n\n\u003e Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.  \n\u003e - [The Vegan Society - Definition of Veganism](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism)\n\nThe claim that ‘veganism is logically impossible' misrepresents the nature of veganism. As with any moral standpoint perfection is not expected. Rather, vegans strive toward the ideal of a world without exploitation and cruelty. However, it is necessary to recognise that it is nearly impossible to exist without cruelty to animals or people while still participating in a 21st century society, and to forgive ourselves for the things we cannot avoid. \n\nTo exist, as far as is possible and practicable*, without exploitation of, or cruelty to, animals is both logical and possible.\n\n#### * What does *possible and practicable* mean?\n\nThis is not an excuse to have a steak when there isn't a vegan option at the restaurant. Eating a boring salad is a very minor discomfort by comparison with the horrors that animals face in slaughterhouses. \n\nNor is it an excuse to not learn those pesky [E-numbers]({{\u003c ref \"/shopping/e-numbers\" \u003e}}). The mistreatment of animals does not compare to committing these to memory, or carrying around the TalkVeganToMe App.\n\n\n\n\u003e *Possible and practicable* is NOT a line vegans draw for themselves to mitigate some perceived inconvenience. it is a reference to the threshold a ‘rational person’ would set; ‘all other things being equal’. \n\nThis appeal to a rational person is not an excuse to gatekeep veganism by arguing against other peoples' decisions. Remember you do not have all the facts when someone relays a story about a time they had to make a difficult decision.\n\nMoral decisions are not arbitrary, but neither is it your role to act as jury for other people's decisions. The 'rational person' clause simply provides a medium for academic discussions regarding veganism.\n\nNo-one can take your v-card away, and you cannot take anyone else's away either.\n",

We are just animals ourselves, it's natural.\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e Animals do eat other animals, but animals are not who we look to for examples of moral behaviour. We wouldn't say it's okay to kill members of our own species because animals do it. Or rape one another because animals do it. Just because something is 'natural' does not make it right.\n\n## Detail - Analytic\n\nThis is a classic example of the Appeal to Nature Fallacy\n\n\u003e [The Appeal to Nature Fallacy] is the belief that what is natural must be good [...] and that which is unnatural must be bad [...].\n\u003e - Logically Fallacious - Bo Bennet - 2012\n\nEarthquakes are natural, pain is natural, our own death is natural, but just because they are natural does not mean that they are good. Cars are 'unnatural', pain relief is unnatural, food standards and sanitation are unnatural, but that does not mean they are bad.  \n\n## Detail - Emotive\n\nTied up in this argument is often the idea that vegans are 'disconnected from the harsh realities of the world' or 'too weak to do what's necessary'. The actual fact is that veganism stems from a _very real_ understanding of what it means to eat meat. Vegan documentaries are full of footage from slaughterhouses and factory farms, places that people who eat meat typically never see let alone visit. \n\nIt is hard to imagine anything more 'disconnected from the harsh realities of the world' than taking a plastic package of meat and consuming it without ever having even _thought_ of the animal which it came from.\n\n\n",
