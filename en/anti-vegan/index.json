We are just animals ourselves, it's natural.\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e Animals do eat other animals, but animals are not who we look to for examples of moral behaviour. We wouldn't say it's okay to kill members of our own species because animals do it. Or rape one another because animals do it. Just because something is 'natural' does not make it right.\n\n## Detail - Analytic\n\nThis is a classic example of the Appeal to Nature Fallacy\n\n\u003e [The Appeal to Nature Fallacy] is the belief that what is natural must be good [...] and that which is unnatural must be bad [...].\n\u003e - Logically Fallacious - Bo Bennet - 2012\n\nEarthquakes are natural, pain is natural, our own death is natural, but just because they are natural does not mean that they are good. Cars are 'unnatural', pain relief is unnatural, food standards and sanitation are unnatural, but that does not mean they are bad.  \n\n## Detail - Emotive\n\nTied up in this argument is often the idea that vegans are 'disconnected from the harsh realities of the world' or 'too weak to do what's necessary'. The actual fact is that veganism stems from a _very real_ understanding of what it means to eat meat. Vegan documentaries are full of footage from slaughterhouses and factory farms, places that people who eat meat typically never see let alone visit. \n\nIt is hard to imagine anything more 'disconnected from the harsh realities of the world' than taking a plastic package of meat and consuming it without ever having even _thought_ of the animal which it came from.\n\n\n",

Everyone is allowed their own opinion even if you don't agree with it \n2. My opinion informs my actions through choice\n3. My actions, choices, and opinions should all be afforded the same level of acceptance\n\nThis takes a freedom of thought/speech type model and applies it to actions under the guise of 'choice'. And it works intuitively because there are scenarios in which this makes sense!\n\n- It's my choice to drop out of uni\n- It's my choice to dye my hair\n- It's my choice to spend all my money on a holiday instead of saving it for a house\n\nThe key thing that these scenarios have in common, and the necessary component for them to have the freedom of speech/thought model applied to them, is that their repercussions apply only to the person making the choice. Compare this with:\n\n- It's my choice to set your house on fire\n- It's my choice to spend all your money on a holiday\n- It's my choice to kick your shins\n\nWhen the opinion \"I think it would be a good thing to set your house on fire\", which we may not agree with or even respect, is transformed into an action that affects someone other than the person that who holds that opinion, it loses its protection.  \n\nYou may think what you like, and do what you like, so long as it only affects you.\n\nEating meat _incontrovertibly_ affects others. It is unavoidable that an animal dies in order to produce meat. You *cannot* use a defence grounded in freedom of thought to justify killing. If you demand respect for your choice to kill something else purely because your choice demands respect, you need to provide an argument as to why the same respect should not be given to some-one who wishes to kill you.",
