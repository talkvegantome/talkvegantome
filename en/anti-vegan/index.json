Fine they are killed at the end of their lives, but they still get to live!\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e A world without animals being exploited by humans sounds like a wonderful world. Wild animals would continue to exist, we could even re-introduce breeds of wild sheep, cows, and pigs to the [vast areas of land]({{\u003c ref \"facts/land-usage\"\u003e}}) currently used for farming.  All the livestock that are alive today will be killed [within 18 months]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animal-life-expectancy\"\u003e}}) (barring dairy cows whose constant pregnancy goes on for up to 4 years). It is a cycle of oppression without end. Stop the next generation of animals being slaughtered, go vegan.\n\n## Detail\n\nThis argument is predicated on the idea that it's better to have a life than not, which seems intuitively compelling at first, if _wildly_ debatable considering some of the horrors of animal agriculture. But let's put that argument aside for a moment, because it has a hidden conclusion that:\n\n\u003e Because I'm giving a life to these animals in the first place, we can overlook the fact that I kill them for profit in [as little as 1.6% of their natural lifespan]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animal-life-expectancy\"\u003e}}).\n\nLet's take the lifespan of the animal destined to live the longest percentage of the natural lifespan, the dairy cow. They are [typically slaughtered at 4 years old]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animal-life-expectancy\"\u003e}}), which is 16-20% of their 15-20 natural year lifespan. In human terms (assuming an average lifespan of 80, which is generous), that would mean they would have been slaughtered at the age of 13-15. \n\nIt's hard to think of applying the same argument to some-one farming humans to the age of 13-15 years old. \"Oh but they have a good life while they're alive!\" rings false when life ends so abruptly and so early.\n\nForests could recover land from which they were lost, animals would actually flourish if the land dedicated to animal agriculture was left fallow. It's a more verdant, more diverse world that we would stand to see if animal agriculture came to an end.",

I don't want to be that awkward person at a party going *imitates nasal voice* err, I'm a vegan, is your cake vegan? \n\nor \n\n\u003e I'm not going to ask my mum what's in zir cooking and refuse to eat it if it's not vegan, ze will crucify me!\n\n# Rebuttal  \n\n\u003e Awkwardness is part and parcel of standing up for what you believe in. If you're not willing to stand up for veganism, what other moral convictions will you cast aside when it becomes too awkward to express them? In order for our actions and morality to matter we've got to voice it when it's important. Otherwise you are just following whatever is socially acceptable rather than thinking critically about your opinions.\n\n## Detail\n\nThis was a big part of the reason that I was vegetarian for a year prior to going vegan. I felt there was a lot of stigma with the word vegan and didn't want to be associated with it. I didn't want to be mocked, and I didn't want to have to explain myself under the attention of numerous people. I was embarrassed. Eventually I realised a number of things:  \n\n1. Opting out of what I believed as a moral conviction because I was scared to associate with it was not the best version of myself. It was a betrayal of my core values.\n2. You get to choose how to act as a vegan. You can be as quiet or as loud as you like, you can be as compassionate or outraged at carnists as you like. Be the vegan you wish you had met. No-one can take your v-card away.\n3. The impression you have of veganism almost certainly comes from the most vocal/controversial portions of the community. If you don't identify with that, that's fine, there's the vast majority of the vegan community you haven't heard from.\n4. The outrage you see from the most controversial activists is very justified. If [70 billion]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animals-killed-annually\"\u003e}}) humans were being killed needlessly every year we would judge people who _weren't_ outraged.\n5. You don't have to approve of all actions of all other vegans. There is tonnes of internal debate and saying \"I don't agree with that\" is absolutely fine so long as you still don't use animal products!\n6. You being the vegan you want to see in the world is a chance to change people's mind about veganism, it is an act of activism in itself to share your form of compassion and discussion with other people, even on a very low-key level.\n\n# Advice \n\n## Family\nFamily in particular can be _really_ hard to tackle with veganism, in part because many families use food as an expression of love. If not handled carefully, even a highly-non-confrontational passing on a plate of food can come across as rejection of it as 'not good enough', which can make the parent in turn feel inadequate or rejected personally.  \n\nWhat you put in your body is **your choice**, however. You should never feel obliged to put consume anything you don't feel comfortable with just to please some-one else. When approached with honesty and compassion, and crucially clarity that it is not a rejection of their cooking, of their love, or of them, an understanding can usually be found. A great way of dealing with it is offering to cook for your family in order to A) show them that vegan food is not just lettuce and grated carrots and B) that you are willing to put in the effort to show some goodwill.\n\n## Friends \u0026 Colleagues\nSocial situations can be tough in general, especially when you don't know the crowd's disposition towards veganism. Remember to take into account your own level of comfort with attention, and desire to talk about veganism when choosing your approach. It can be a great opportunity to talk about veganism with a new crowd, but you're no less vegan if you aren't comfortable with the spotlight on you and choose to fly under the radar as much as possible.\n\n",

Imagine how much higher that is when there is no oversight.\n\nIn all types of consumption in a 21st century society there is almost guaranteed to be some form of cruelty, and this must stop in all its forms. The difference with animal agriculture, however, is that stopping the cruelty without stopping the practice itself is impossible because the subject of the cruelty _is the product_. It's possible to imagine a world, campaign for a world, vote for a world, spend towards a world where the production of consumer goods and food does not involve the suffering of human beings (and we should!). But it is not possible to have a world where animal agriculture does not have suffering when animals are the product. Any business will try to maximise profits and minimise costs, often at the expense of the humans working for them, and this inherent opposition between profit and welfare will always see welfare lose out because animals cannot advocate for themselves. It is nearly impossible for a minimum wage worker who needs the income to blow the whistle on unsafe or inhumane working conditions without putting their family's livelihood in jeopardy. Animals are similarly silenced, unable to speak for themselves and tell a story even to those who will listen.\n",

Just because animals are not self-aware (sapient) does not give us the right to cause them suffering and death. \n\nThe famous quote from Jeremy Bentham is appropriate here: \n\n\u003e What else is it that should trace the insuperable line [between those afforded protection by the law and those that are not]? Is it the faculty of reason, or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? [T]he question is not, Can they reason? nor Can they talk? but Can they suffer?  \n\u003e  - Jeremy Bentham – An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation - 1789 - p311\n\n## Detail - Analytic \n\n### Sapience vs Sentience\n\nFirst let's clear up some common confusion around the world 'sentience'. \n\n\u003e A sentient being is capable of experiencing things through its senses.  \n\u003e - [Collins English Dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sentient)\n\nSo animals are clearly sentient because they have ears and eyes and noses through which to sense the world.\n\n\u003e [Sentience vs Sapience] is the distinction between being aware in the sense of being merely\nawake (which we share with nondiscursive animals - those that do not grasp concepts), on the one hand, and, on the other hand, being aware in a sense that involves knowledge either by being a kind of knowledge, or as potentially serving to justify judgments that so qualify.  \n\u003e - Robert Brandom's Study Guide to Wilfrid Sellars' Empricism and the Philosophy of Mind - Harvard University Press - 1997 - p121-122\n\nSapience is what most people are thinking of when they mean sentience. The ability to know things and reason with that knowledge.\n\n\n### Sapience Matters - Suffering is worse with sapience\n\n\u003e It's okay to eat animals because they are not sapient. The suffering of animals is less because they cannot anticipate their death, or understand that they are going to be slaughtered.  \n\nEven if this were true (it's not, animals at slaughterhouses know full well what's going to happen to them!) the idea that a hypothetical human's existential dread while being 'raised' for slaughter would be that much greater suffering than an animal's experience does not diminish the animal's suffering in any way. It is wrong to cause suffering, it is wrong to take someone's life away even if they are unable to anticipate it. \n\n# Sources\n\n- Robert Brandom's Study Guide to Wilfrid Sellars' Empricism and the Philosophy of Mind - Harvard University Press - 1997 \n- [Jeremy Bentham – An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation - 1789](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xqkSAQAAMAAJ\u0026dq=An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Principles%20of%20Morals%20and%20Legislation\u0026pg=PA311#v=onepage\u0026q\u0026f=false)",

This has already lead to the blossoming of vegan options in supermarkets around the world with companies rushing to take advantage of increasing vegan market.  \nEven if supply and demand didn't have an impact on companies production choices (e.g. milk subsidies in the US) we implicitly take a position on the morality of these industries by deciding whether or not we participate in them. Just because we cannot stop animal cruelty does not mean we should be part of it.\n\nThis fatalistic argument suggests that because an injustice is the status quo and there is no reasonable hope of ending it that we are morally justified in participating in it.  \n\n### Thought Experiment - Yulin Dog Festival\nLet's look at that through the lens of a different example, not even a terribly different one. Eating dogs.  \nAs a tourist to China you visit Yulin during the summer solstice, and visit the [Yulin Dog Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychee_and_Dog_Meat_Festival) where freshly cooked dog flesh is as available on the streets as pig and sheep flesh is all year round the world over.  \nUnder normal circumstances you (presumably) find the idea of killing and eating dogs morally abhorrent, do you suspend this value judgement and eat the dog meat in Yulin? If not, why not? No more or fewer dogs will be killed based on your decision.  \n\nIf the answer is \"because it's still wrong\" then you need to face that this is true of other animals as well, irrespective of whether or not you abstain from consuming them would result in a direct reduction of suffering.  \n\nIf the answer is \"Because I find it personally uncomfortable but I would be okay with it otherwise\" then we're getting down to the core of the issue. Why are you okay with eating dog abstractly if you believe killing dogs for food is wrong? \"There's no negative consequence to eating the dog once it's already dead. Why not eat it if you want to?\"\n\nIn the Yulin dog festival scenario there are two things wrong with this:\n\n1. You will be supporting the industry by paying for the meal, that money goes back into next year's festival to breed more dogs for slaughter.\n2. There is a disconnect here between the ethics of your actions and the ethics of the consequences of your actions.\n\n### Thought Experiment - Dead Body at the Side of the Road\nLet's look at the aforementioned ethical disconnect between actions and consequences through the light of another thought experiment.  \n\nSuppose you find a body on the side of the road, killed by a hit and run. Rather morbidly you rifle through the journal you find in their pocket learning they are entirely alone in this world and unmissed by anyone. You are miles away from any jurisdiction, on a disused logging road deep in the forest, the police will never find the body.  \nIs it ethical to eat the body?  \n\nMost people will be repulsed by the question and say of course it isn't ethical, how could it be? Eating people is inherently wrong, unlike animals.  \nBut what is the difference between this scenario and the Yulin dog scenario? If anything this scenario is _more_ clear from negative consequences because you're not providing monetary support to the person who did the killing, and therefore are not contributing to the likelihood that more people will be killed. \n\nThe difference is that you've successfully internalised that eating people is wrong irrespective of the circumstances, and are therefore unwilling to eat people _even_ if it doesn't make a difference to how likely it is for more people to die.  \n\nIt is this internalisation of rightness or wrongness that most vegans hinge on when they make the decision not to consume animal products. It's not _even about_ whether or not an individual can make a difference (hint they can, influentially, in aggregate, and over time), it's about whether the action is fundamentally right or wrong.\n\nIt is, at its core, about the fact that an animal had to die in order for you to be able to eat them.\n\n## Detail - Analytic - Monetary Support\n\nThe second problem with saying \"it's okay to eat a dog in the Yulin dog festival\" when you disagree with the concept of killing dogs for food, is that irrespective of whether your purchasing the dog meat makes the dog any less dead, that purchasing decision _is_ the demand that business owners take into account when they make stock decisions. \n\nYour money from purchasing the dog meat will go towards breeding more dogs for next year's festival, and even if the amount you pay is paltry, it has to be considered in aggregate. If every tourist supports the dog meat industry, it will grow to accommodate that demand. If none of them do, it will shrink accordingly. \n\n## Detail - Motive - Impact of Individual's Actions - All Actions are Activism in an Oppressive System\n\nAll political movements engaged with righting a wrong throughout history have been composed of individuals. Without individuals there is no movement, and every action you take in service of animal liberation is an act of resistance against the status quo. The waiter whom you ask for the vegan option, might just think 'huh, so many people are ordering that these days, I should check it out'. Your conversation with your friend might plant the seed of receptivity to veganism, and they might inspire others in turn to go vegan. The animal rights march you take part in might be the biggest ever and make the news. You might inspire, or get inspired through activism to be, a driving force in the animal rights movement.  \n\nEvery action, no matter how small, matters. You don't have to boil the ocean, you just have to make a splash.\n\nWhatever you do, just don't forget, veganism is not for vegans.  \n\n**Veganism is for the animals.**",

The unintentional deaths of earthworms when tilling, or field mice when harvesting are not _necessary_ for the production of crops, it is not the intention to kill animals when harvesting crops. It is the definitionally the intention when raising animals for slaughter.\n\nThis distinction falls down somewhat when we consider pesticides, animal-based fertilizers, and beekeeping for pollination. This is why some vegans seek out foods from [vegan farms](https://www.viva.org.uk/what-we-do/vegan-farming). Ultimately however each person's 'possible and practicable' is a line they have to draw for themselves and this may not be within the means or motivations of every vegan. It is not necessary to be perfect to be vegan.\n\n### Moral Consistency\n\nTrying to trip vegans up by exposing real or imagined inconsistencies is a common avenue of argument against veganism. The reality is that vegans (being human) are typically not perfect. Vegans are subject to the constraints of time, money, knowledge, and availability of resources amongst a million other factors. We quoted the definition of veganism in our quick response but it's so important it bears repeating: \n\n\u003e Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals  for food, clothing or any other purpose.  \n\u003e - [The Vegan Society - Definition of Veganism](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism)\n\nEach person's 'possible and practicable' is a line they have to draw for themselves. It is not necessary to be perfect to be vegan. \n\nThis is not an excuse to have a steak when there isn't a vegan option at the restaurant. Eating a boring salad is a very minor discomfort in comparison to choosing to endorse the horrors animals face in slaughterhouses. It is only that it is necessary to recognise that it is nearly impossible to without cruelty to animals or people while still participating in a 21st century society, and to forgive ourselves for the things we cannot avoid.",

Compare this with:\n\n- It's my choice to set your house on fire\n- It's my choice to spend all your money on a holiday\n- It's my choice to kick your shins\n\nWhen the opinion \"I think it would be a good thing to set your house on fire\", which we may not agree with or even respect, is transformed into an action that affects someone other than the person that who holds that opinion, it loses its protection.  \n\nYou may think what you like, and do what you like, so long as it only affects you.\n\nEating meat _incontrovertibly_ affects others. It is unavoidable that an animal dies in order to produce meat. You *cannot* use a defence grounded in freedom of thought to justify killing. If you demand respect for your choice to kill something else purely because your choice demands respect, you need to provide an argument as to why the same respect should not be given to some-one who wishes to kill you.",
