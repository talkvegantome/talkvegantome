Do the best you can, but try not to overwhelm yourself.\n\n### Vegetarian Products\n\nIt's easy to be lulled into a false sense of security by products made from vegetarian manufacturers like Quorn. But keep a watchful eye on the ingredients of these products as they commonly contain non-vegan ingredients even when you least expect!\n\n### E Numbers\n\n- E120 - Never vegan\n- E322 - Usually vegan\n- E422 - Usually vegan\n- E542 - Never vegan\n- E631 - Usually not vegan\n- E901 - Never vegan\n- E904 - Never vegan\n- E471 - Usually vegan\n- E920 - Check for further information\n\n**Source:** [Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/whats-new/blog/how-avoid-buying-non-vegan-products)\n\n### Gotchas\n\n- Honey\n- Beer/Wine\n- Bread (Regional. particularly in the UK often contains milk)\n- Smoothies (Often contain yogurt)\n- Chocolate (Dark chocolate is usually fine, but always check the packaging for milk!)\n\n## Clothes\n\nOften less thought about than food, the following products on clothes will not be vegan.\n\n- Leather (including Suede)\n- Wool\n- Silk\n- Fur\n- Feathers\n\n### Gotchas\n\nIt's advisable to patronise vegan shoe establishments in particular as glues used in the manufacturing process for shoes made of otherwise vegan materials will make the shoes not vegan.\n\n## Toiletries\n\nWith all items, but particularly makeup, some research is required to determine whether animal testing was involved in the research and development stages of the product.\n\n### Gotchas\n\n- Bar soap is usually made with animal fat\n- 'Cruelty free' does not mean it is free from animal products\n\n## Household items\n\nEverything from household cleansers to pillows may contain animal products, as always it's important to read the ingredients.  \n\n### Gotchas\n\n- Pillows often contain feathers\n\n## Resources\n\n- Beer [Barnivore](http://www.barnivore.com/) is a great source of information\n",
