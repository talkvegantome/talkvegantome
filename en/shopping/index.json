But keep a watchful eye on the ingredients of these products as they commonly contain non-vegan ingredients even when you least expect! \n\n## Resources\n\n- Beer [Barnivore](http://www.barnivore.com/) is a great source of information\n- [Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/lifestyle/food-and-drink)",
