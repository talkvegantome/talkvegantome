<h2 id="progress-this-week">Progress this week</h2>

<p>This week has actually been extremely productive! I carved out 2 days to focus on the app and do nothing else, which helped immensely.</p>

<p>The biggest thing is we have a newly skinned website!</p>

<p><a href="http://talkveganto.me">http://talkveganto.me</a></p>

<p>The website was always there, but it looked rather like a corporate intranet so I was hesitant to distribute the address too much. I&rsquo;d love to say that the design was all my work, but it was thanks to the skill of some-one I hired on Fiverr that we have the design. I just took the design and applied it as a Hugo template.</p>

<p>Additionally, we also have a number of promotional screenshots designed! Again from some-one on Fiverr. These will go in the App Store page to make it a bit more attractive to people who are just browsing through randomly. You can see these here: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/T3mLLAC">https://imgur.com/a/T3mLLAC</a></p>

<p>As for articles we have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anti Vegan - It&rsquo;s too weird/counter cultural</li>
<li>Anti-Vegan - Animals are slaughtered humanely</li>
<li>Anti-Vegan - Animals aren&rsquo;t Sentient/Sapient</li>
<li>Facts - Animals slaughtered annually (improved to provide an explanation of how to generate figures from the UN&rsquo;s FAO statistics)</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact there&rsquo;s only one article left in the pre-release pool!</p>

<h2 id="roadmap-to-release">Roadmap to Release</h2>

<p>Prior to the release I need to do the following</p>

<ul>
<li>Write &lsquo;Anti Vegan - Without farming there would be no animals&rsquo;</li>
<li>Update Almond Milk Water Usage article with latest stats</li>
<li>Proofread all articles!</li>
<li>Add tutorial to app to indicate workflow</li>
<li>Put a Table of Contents at the bottom of the page in app to make navigation easier</li>
<li>Make the app scroll back to the top of the page on navigate to new page</li>
<li>Setup talkvegantome.com in addition to .me</li>
<li>Create a media pack for the site (logos, blurb, etc.)
And then it&rsquo;s ready to release!</li>
</ul>

<p>Honestly I&rsquo;m getting quite excited, the end is in sight after a couple of month&rsquo;s worth of work.
The biggest gap currently is the marketing strategy. I think it&rsquo;s going to be quite hard to get the word out as I&rsquo;ve had very limited responses to my attempts to reach out to vegan news outlets and influencers. This means I&rsquo;m going to be relying on word of mouth a lot which&hellip; Is unpredictable but probably has a better chance in the vegan community as it&rsquo;s quite well engaged!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see how it goes. I&rsquo;m setting my launch expectations low so I won&rsquo;t be sad if it just gets 10 downloads in the first week!</p>

<p>Fingers crossed!</p>

<h1 id="2019-07-07">2019-07-07</h1>

<h2 id="the-saga-of-1-6th-of-an-acre">The Saga of 1/6th of an Acre</h2>

<p>I have finally found the original source for the Cowspiracy fact that 1/6th of an acre is required to feed a vegan and 3.5 acres required to feed a meat eater.
Cowspiracy (2014) cites an Earthsave article (2006) which cites a book called Diet for a new America (1987) which cites an article called Proteins (1965) which cites another article called Land Use and Food Production (1961) which cites a book Our Developing World (1960) which cites the 1948-1952 UN FAO statistics on food production to compare a JAPANESE diet (which takes 1/6th of an acre to feed one person) and an American diet (which takes 2.5 acres and got rounded up somewhere along the way).</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s not even a vegan diet at all! The much better stat is: Beef consumed in the United States requires around 160x as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice for the same number of calories, and nearly 100x as much land for the same amount of protein. Which is sourced from a 2014 article on comparative land usage.
Other Progress this Week</p>

<p>I spent quite a lot of time researching the above last week as it required 2-3 trips to the British Library to fetch the ancient articles and books which weren&rsquo;t available anywhere else. I only managed to finish:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anti-Vegan Arguments - One Person Can&rsquo;t Make a Difference</li>
<li>And made some progress but didn&rsquo;t release</li>
<li>Anti-Vegan Arguments - It&rsquo;s Okay to Kill Animals Because They Aren&rsquo;t Sentient/Sapient</li>
</ul>

<p>Which is not an argument you see very often I don&rsquo;t think but it one that holds special value to me because it&rsquo;s what I believed before going vegan!</p>

<h2 id="contributions-this-week">Contributions this Week</h2>

<p>I had two people reach out to me this week with suggestions for content and the app, one in particular being a very detailed set of feedback for app design which was extremely helpful!
I can&rsquo;t overstate how much it means to hear from people using the app, so please keep reaching out by replying to this email, even if it&rsquo;s just a tiny suggestion or piece of feedback it means a great deal!
As always, you can see the pipeline for content on the <a href="https://trello.com/b/7ecEPfjW/talkvegantome-content">Trello board</a>!</p>

<h1 id="2019-06-29">2019-06-29</h1>

<h2 id="the-past-two-weeks">The Past Two Weeks</h2>

<p>The past two weeks have been quiet as expected due to a week&rsquo;s holiday!
I had secretly hoped to spend some time writing even on holiday, but I think for mental health&rsquo;s sake it&rsquo;s a good thing I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>This week I&rsquo;ve been figuring out how to tackle one of the biggest remaining challenges for content which is the &ldquo;Anti Vegan Arguments&rdquo; section.
My first attempt at this section ended up being merged into the &ldquo;Vegan Facts&rdquo; section, primarily because the format warranted a clear differentiation between &ldquo;analysis of facts&rdquo; and &ldquo;rebuttal of arguments&rdquo; and it didn&rsquo;t make sense to keep them under the same section.</p>

<p>In creating the new &ldquo;rebuttal of arguments&rdquo; vision for anti-vegan-arguments I was heavily inspired by Earthling Ed&rsquo;s 30 Non Vegan Excuses. In fact the original scope for this section was to reach out to Ed and ask for permission to redistribute some of the chapters. Since then however I&rsquo;ve become more accepting of writing content for the app, and wanted to produce something unique rather than simply reword it. Especially because as the app is community based and editable by anyone, we would either have to lock Ed&rsquo;s chapters as immutable, or allow people to edit them, neither of which seemed good options.</p>

<p>In writing these pages I wanted to bring as much of the analytic rigor from the fact check pages as I could, and in my first attempt this sent me spiralling down a rabbit hole of analytic philosophy akin to my degree coursework. What the app needed though was not some 10,000 word dense philosophical analysis with a vocabulary only academics could understand, so I settled on a much simpler format that only used citations where absolutely necessary (e.g. for the facts!).</p>

<p>The ones I&rsquo;ve finished so far are:</p>

<ul>
<li>No Food is Truly Vegan</li>
<li>Personal Choice</li>
<li>Animals Eat other Animals</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m reasonably happy with what I&rsquo;ve got so far, continuing with the summary sections at the top and splitting out the detailed analysis further down into Analytic and Emotive arguments, with no judgement intended as to the validity of either section. The purpose of these sections is purely to allow you to tailor your response to the person you&rsquo;re debating.</p>

<p>Prior to release I&rsquo;ve committed to finishing rebuttals to the following as well:</p>

<ul>
<li>Animals are Slaughtered Humanely</li>
<li>Animals aren&rsquo;t &lsquo;sentient&rsquo;</li>
<li>Without Farming there would be no animals</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s too extreme/weird</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, I still need to take the design from last week and apply it to the website, and get a complete marketing strategy in place. On this aspect I had some positive feedback earlier today from a vegan podcast who said they&rsquo;d be interested in seeing the app when complete and would mention it as part of the podcast if they liked it, which is great news as so far I&rsquo;ve had naff all response from other vegan news sites and influencers.</p>

<p>Anyway, this has run extremely long, hope you&rsquo;ve all had a wonderful few weeks and as ever, let me know if you have any ideas for the app, or any comments about the content!</p>

<p>As always, you can see the pipeline for content on the <a href="https://trello.com/b/7ecEPfjW/talkvegantome-content">Trello board</a>!</p>

<h1 id="2019-06-15">2019-06-15</h1>

<p>This week has been much less productive for a couple of reasons. Firstly I took it as a bit of a self-care week, as I&rsquo;ve been spending every waking moment on the app for 2-3 months now!
Secondly, I was a bit stuck on how to get from where I am to &ldquo;released&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve been enjoying writing articles on facts and their sources, but we have enough for the moment and writing more wouldn&rsquo;t actually get me any closer to released. My vision for TalkVeganToMe was not just a &ldquo;vegan snopes&rdquo; but a one-stop-shop for quick reference of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rebuttals to vegan arguments</li>
<li>Ethical purchasing advice</li>
<li>&lsquo;Further information&rdquo;. Books, films, organisations, podcasts, youtube channels</li>
<li>Fact&rsquo;s sources</li>
</ol>

<p>The first three are broadly the killer features from an app perspective. My original use case was someone in a shop (me) looking up e-numbers quickly.
The fourth however is probably most often going to be used in debates on social media, and not the app at all. The fourth is also probably the most compelling unique selling point.
That&rsquo;s when I realised that most likely people&rsquo;s first experiences with TalkVeganToMe is going to be the website, irrespective of much I am in love with the app and want them to use it.</p>

<p>So I came up with the following path-to-released.</p>

<ol>
<li>Make the website something I&rsquo;m proud of.</li>
<li>Write rebuttals to vegan arguments</li>
<li>Polish up ethical purchasing advice</li>
<li>Final review of all content&rsquo;s accuracy and legibility</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m debating adding a fifth:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a search function to the app and website.</li>
</ol>

<p>I very much want this to be a feature at some point, but I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s necessary for release (i.e. if people will take one look at the app and think: unusable). Let me know what you think!</p>

<p>As an aside, next week is not going to be a super productive one either as I&rsquo;m on holiday!</p>

<p>As always, you can see the pipeline for content on the <a href="https://trello.com/b/7ecEPfjW/talkvegantome-content">Trello board</a>!</p>

<h1 id="2019-06-08">2019-06-08</h1>

<p>This week has been super productive, focussing pretty much entirely on content and investigating some really interesting stats!</p>

<p>This week I managed to add</p>

<ul>
<li>Facts - Ocean Plastic is mostly nets</li>
<li>Facts - Most soy is fed to cattle</li>
<li>Facts - WHO, FDA, BDA endorsements for vegan diets</li>
<li>Facts - Almond Milk Water Usage</li>
<li>Facts - Land Usage</li>
<li>Facts - Tofu Causes Deforestation</li>
<li>Vegan Lifestyle &amp; Culture - Defined Documentaries template</li>
<li>Vegan Lifestyle &amp; Culture - Defined and fleshed out Organisations</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see the pipeline for content on the Trello board.</p>

<p>Some of these, particularly the Land Usage and Almond Milk Water Usage stats were really fascinating to explore the original sources, and uncovered some pretty egregious misrepresentations of data.</p>

<h1 id="2019-06-01">2019-06-01</h1>

<p>Thanks for signing up to the beta and downloading the app. Hopefully you&rsquo;ve had a chance to browse around and make sure it works for you.
Probably the first thing you&rsquo;ll notice is that it is light on content. I&rsquo;m working hard to rectify this, but as I&rsquo;m just one person this is subject to my own schedule and may end up being a touch sporadic in updates!</p>

<p>This week I managed to add:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anti-Vegan Arguments - Protein</li>
<li>Vegan Statistics - Animal Life Expectancy</li>
<li>Vegan Statistics - Animal Slaughter Methods</li>
<li>How to contribute</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see the pipeline for content on the Trello board.
I&rsquo;m always looking for new ideas, especially for stats to add, so just reply to this email with any ideas you&rsquo;ve got and I&rsquo;ll add them to the board!</p>
