Fine they are killed at the end of their lives, but they still get to live!\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e A world without animals being exploited by humans sounds like a wonderful world. Wild animals would continue to exist, we could even re-introduce breeds of wild sheep, cows, and pigs to the [vast areas of land]({{\u003c ref \"facts/land-usage\"\u003e}}) currently used for farming.  All the livestock that are alive today will be killed [within 18 months]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animal-life-expectancy\"\u003e}}) (barring dairy cows whose constant pregnancy goes on for up to 4 years). It is a cycle of oppression without end. Stop the next generation of animals being slaughtered, go vegan.\n\n## Detail\n\nThis argument is predicated on the idea that it's better to have a life than not, which seems intuitively compelling at first, if _wildly_ debatable considering some of the horrors of animal agriculture. But let's put that argument aside for a moment, because it has a hidden conclusion that:\n\n\u003e Because I'm giving a life to these animals in the first place, we can overlook the fact that I kill them for profit in [as little as 1.6% of their natural lifespan]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animal-life-expectancy\"\u003e}}).\n\nLet's take the lifespan of the animal destined to live the longest percentage of the natural lifespan, the dairy cow. They are [typically slaughtered at 4 years old]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animal-life-expectancy\"\u003e}}), which is 16-20% of their 15-20 natural year lifespan. In human terms (assuming an average lifespan of 80, which is generous), that would mean they would have been slaughtered at the age of 13-15. \n\nIt's hard to think of applying the same argument to some-one farming humans to the age of 13-15 years old. \"Oh but they have a good life while they're alive!\" rings false when life ends so abruptly and so early.\n\nForests could recover land from which they were lost, animals would actually flourish if the land dedicated to animal agriculture was left fallow. It's a more verdant, more diverse world that we would stand to see if animal agriculture came to an end.",

I don't want to be that awkward person at a party asking if everything is vegan! \n\nor \n\n\u003e I'm not going to ask my mum what's in her cooking and refuse to eat it if it's not vegan, she will crucify me!\n\n# Rebuttal  \n\n\u003e Awkwardness is part and parcel of standing up for what you believe in. If you're not willing to stand up for veganism, what other moral convictions will you cast aside when it becomes too awkward to express them? In order for our actions and morality to matter we've got to voice it when it's important. Otherwise you are just following whatever is socially acceptable rather than thinking critically about your opinions.\n\n## Detail\n\nThis was a big part of the reason that I was vegetarian for a year prior to going vegan. I felt there was a lot of stigma with the word vegan and didn't want to be associated with it. I didn't want to be mocked, and I didn't want to have to explain myself under the attention of numerous people. I was embarrassed. Eventually I realised a number of things:  \n\n1. Opting out of what I believed as a moral conviction because I was scared to associate with it was not the best version of myself. It was a betrayal of my core values.\n2. You get to choose how to act as a vegan. You can be as quiet or as loud as you like, you can be as compassionate or outraged at carnists as you like. Be the vegan you wish you had met. No-one can take your v-card away.\n3. The impression you have of veganism almost certainly comes from the most vocal/controversial portions of the community. If you don't identify with that, that's fine, there's the vast majority of the vegan community you haven't heard from.\n4. The outrage you see from the most controversial activists is very justified. If [70 billion]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animals-killed-annually\"\u003e}}) humans were being killed needlessly every year we would judge people who _weren't_ outraged.\n5. You don't have to approve of all actions of all other vegans. There is tonnes of internal debate and saying \"I don't agree with that\" is absolutely fine so long as you still don't use animal products!\n6. You being the vegan you want to see in the world is a chance to change people's mind about veganism, it is an act of activism in itself to share your form of compassion and discussion with other people, even on a very low-key level.\n\n# Advice \n\n## Family\nFamily in particular can be _really_ hard to tackle with veganism, in part because many families use food as an expression of love. If not handled carefully, even a highly-non-confrontational passing on a plate of food can come across as rejection of it as 'not good enough', which can make the parent in turn feel inadequate or rejected personally.  \n\nWhat you put in your body is **your choice**, however. You should never feel obliged to consume anything you don't feel comfortable with just to please some-one else. When approached with honesty and compassion, and crucially clarity that it is not a rejection of their cooking, of their love, or of them, an understanding can usually be found. A great way of dealing with it is offering to cook for your family in order to A) show them that vegan food is not just lettuce and grated carrots and B) that you are willing to put in the effort to show some goodwill.\n\n## Friends \u0026 Colleagues\nSocial situations can be tough in general, especially when you don't know the crowd's disposition towards veganism. Remember to take into account your own level of comfort with attention, and desire to talk about veganism when choosing your approach. It can be a great opportunity to talk about veganism with a new crowd, but you're no less vegan if you aren't comfortable with the spotlight on you and choose to fly under the radar as much as possible.\n\n",

Imagine how much higher that is when there is no oversight.\n\nIn all types of consumption in a 21st century society there is almost guaranteed to be some form of cruelty, and this must stop in all its forms. The difference with animal agriculture, however, is that stopping the cruelty without stopping the practice itself is impossible because the subject of the cruelty _is the product_. It's possible to imagine a world, campaign for a world, vote for a world, spend towards a world where the production of consumer goods and food does not involve the suffering of human beings (and we should!). But it is not possible to have a world where animal agriculture does not have suffering when animals are the product. Any business will try to maximise profits and minimise costs, often at the expense of the humans working for them, and this inherent opposition between profit and welfare will always see welfare lose out because animals cannot advocate for themselves. It is nearly impossible for a minimum wage worker who needs the income to blow the whistle on unsafe or inhumane working conditions without putting their family's livelihood in jeopardy. Animals are similarly silenced, unable to speak for themselves and tell a story even to those who will listen.\n",

          "rawContent": "\n# Argument \n\n\u003e It's okay to kill animals because they aren't sentient/sapient\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e Animals can sense the world around them just like we can, feel pain just like we can, and they _most definitely_ can suffer, just like we can. Just because animals are not self-aware (sapient) does not give us the right to cause them suffering and death. \n\nThe famous quote from Jeremy Bentham is appropriate here: \n\n\u003e What else is it that should trace the insuperable line [between those afforded protection by the law and those that are not]? Is it the faculty of reason, or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? [T]he question is not, Can they reason? nor Can they talk? but Can they suffer?  \n\u003e  - Jeremy Bentham – An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation - 1789 - p311\n\n## Detail - Analytic \n\n### Sapience vs Sentience\n\nFirst let's clear up some common confusion around the world 'sentience'. \n\n\u003e A sentient being is capable of experiencing things through its senses.  \n\u003e - [Collins English Dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sentient)\n\nSo animals are clearly sentient because they have ears and eyes and noses through which to sense the world.\n\n\u003e [Sentience vs Sapience] is the distinction between being aware in the sense of being merely\nawake (which we share with nondiscursive animals - those that do not grasp concepts), on the one hand, and, on the other hand, being aware in a sense that involves knowledge either by being a kind of knowledge, or as potentially serving to justify judgments that so qualify.  \n\u003e - Robert Brandom's Study Guide to Wilfrid Sellars' Empricism and the Philosophy of Mind - Harvard University Press - 1997 - p121-122\n\nSapience is what most people are thinking of when they mean sentience. The ability to know things and reason with that knowledge.\n\n\n### Sapience Matters - Suffering is worse with sapience\n\n\u003e It's okay to eat animals because they are not sapient. The suffering of animals is less because they cannot anticipate their death, or understand that they are going to be slaughtered.  \n\nEven if this were true (it's not, animals at slaughterhouses know full well what's going to happen to them!) the idea that a hypothetical human's existential dread while being 'raised' for slaughter would be that much greater suffering than an animal's experience does not diminish the animal's suffering in any way. It is wrong to cause suffering, it is wrong to take someone's life away even if they are unable to anticipate it. \n\n# Sources\n\n- Robert Brandom's Study Guide to Wilfrid Sellars' Empricism and the Philosophy of Mind - Harvard University Press - 1997 \n- [Jeremy Bentham – An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation - 1789](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xqkSAQAAMAAJ\u0026dq=An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Principles%20of%20Morals%20and%20Legislation\u0026pg=PA311#v=onepage\u0026q\u0026f=false)",

This has already lead to the blossoming of vegan options in supermarkets around the world with companies rushing to take advantage of increasing vegan market.  \nEven if supply and demand didn't have an impact on companies production choices (e.g. milk subsidies in the US) we implicitly take a position on the morality of these industries by deciding whether or not we participate in them. Just because we cannot stop animal cruelty does not mean we should be part of it.\n\nThis fatalistic argument suggests that because an injustice is the status quo and there is no reasonable hope of ending it that we are morally justified in participating in it.  \n\n### Thought Experiment - Yulin Dog Festival\nLet's look at that through the lens of a different example, not even a terribly different one. Eating dogs.  \nAs a tourist to China you visit Yulin during the summer solstice, and visit the [Yulin Dog Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychee_and_Dog_Meat_Festival) where freshly cooked dog flesh is as available on the streets as pig and sheep flesh is all year round the world over.  \nUnder normal circumstances you (presumably) find the idea of killing and eating dogs morally abhorrent, do you suspend this value judgement and eat the dog meat in Yulin? If not, why not? No more or fewer dogs will be killed based on your decision.  \n\nIf the answer is \"because it's still wrong\" then you need to face that this is true of other animals as well, irrespective of whether or not you abstain from consuming them would result in a direct reduction of suffering.  \n\nIf the answer is \"Because I find it personally uncomfortable but I would be okay with it otherwise\" then we're getting down to the core of the issue. Why are you okay with eating dog abstractly if you believe killing dogs for food is wrong? \"There's no negative consequence to eating the dog once it's already dead. Why not eat it if you want to?\"\n\nIn the Yulin dog festival scenario there are two things wrong with this:\n\n1. You will be supporting the industry by paying for the meal, that money goes back into next year's festival to breed more dogs for slaughter.\n2. There is a disconnect here between the ethics of your actions and the ethics of the consequences of your actions.\n\n### Thought Experiment - Dead Body at the Side of the Road\nLet's look at the aforementioned ethical disconnect between actions and consequences through the light of another thought experiment.  \n\nSuppose you find a body on the side of the road, killed by a hit and run. Rather morbidly you rifle through the journal you find in their pocket learning they are entirely alone in this world and unmissed by anyone. You are miles away from any jurisdiction, on a disused logging road deep in the forest, the police will never find the body.  \nIs it ethical to eat the body?  \n\nMost people will be repulsed by the question and say of course it isn't ethical, how could it be? Eating people is inherently wrong, unlike animals.  \nBut what is the difference between this scenario and the Yulin dog scenario? If anything this scenario is _more_ clear from negative consequences because you're not providing monetary support to the person who did the killing, and therefore are not contributing to the likelihood that more people will be killed. \n\nThe difference is that you've successfully internalised that eating people is wrong irrespective of the circumstances, and are therefore unwilling to eat people _even_ if it doesn't make a difference to how likely it is for more people to die.  \n\nIt is this internalisation of rightness or wrongness that most vegans hinge on when they make the decision not to consume animal products. It's not _even about_ whether or not an individual can make a difference (hint they can, influentially, in aggregate, and over time), it's about whether the action is fundamentally right or wrong.\n\nIt is, at its core, about the fact that an animal had to die in order for you to be able to eat them.\n\n## Detail - Analytic - Monetary Support\n\nThe second problem with saying \"it's okay to eat a dog in the Yulin dog festival\" when you disagree with the concept of killing dogs for food, is that irrespective of whether your purchasing the dog meat makes the dog any less dead, that purchasing decision _is_ the demand that business owners take into account when they make stock decisions. \n\nYour money from purchasing the dog meat will go towards breeding more dogs for next year's festival, and even if the amount you pay is paltry, it has to be considered in aggregate. If every tourist supports the dog meat industry, it will grow to accommodate that demand. If none of them do, it will shrink accordingly. \n\n## Detail - Motive - Impact of Individual's Actions - All Actions are Activism in an Oppressive System\n\nAll political movements engaged with righting a wrong throughout history have been composed of individuals. Without individuals there is no movement, and every action you take in service of animal liberation is an act of resistance against the status quo. The waiter whom you ask for the vegan option, might just think 'huh, so many people are ordering that these days, I should check it out'. Your conversation with your friend might plant the seed of receptivity to veganism, and they might inspire others in turn to go vegan. The animal rights march you take part in might be the biggest ever and make the news. You might inspire, or get inspired through activism to be, a driving force in the animal rights movement.  \n\nEvery action, no matter how small, matters. You don't have to boil the ocean, you just have to make a splash.\n\nWhatever you do, just don't forget, veganism is not for vegans.  \n\n**Veganism is for the animals.**",

Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals [...].

The unintentional deaths of earthworms when tilling, or field mice when harvesting are not _necessary_ for the production of crops, it is not the intention to kill animals when harvesting crops. It is the definitionally the intention when raising animals for slaughter.\n\nThis distinction falls down somewhat when we consider pesticides, animal-based fertilizers, and beekeeping for pollination. This is why some vegans seek out foods from [vegan farms](https://www.viva.org.uk/what-we-do/vegan-farming). Ultimately however each person's 'possible and practicable' is a line they have to draw for themselves and this may not be within the means or motivations of every vegan. It is not necessary to be perfect to be vegan.\n\n### Moral Consistency\n\nTrying to trip vegans up by exposing real or imagined inconsistencies is a common avenue of argument against veganism. The reality is that vegans (being human) are typically not perfect. Vegans are subject to the constraints of time, money, knowledge, and availability of resources amongst a million other factors. We quoted the definition of veganism in our quick response but it's so important it bears repeating: \n\n\u003e Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals  for food, clothing or any other purpose.  \n\u003e - [The Vegan Society - Definition of Veganism](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism)\n\nEach person's 'possible and practicable' is a line they have to draw for themselves. It is not necessary to be perfect to be vegan. \n\nThis is not an excuse to have a steak when there isn't a vegan option at the restaurant. Eating a boring salad is a very minor discomfort in comparison to choosing to endorse the horrors animals face in slaughterhouses. It is only that it is necessary to recognise that it is nearly impossible to without cruelty to animals or people while still participating in a 21st century society, and to forgive ourselves for the things we cannot avoid.",

          "rawContent": "\n# Argument \n\n\u003e Vegans have a profound misunderstanding of the circle of life. Animals eat other animals, you can't change that. We are just animals ourselves, it's natural.\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e Animals do eat other animals, but animals are not who we look to for examples of moral behaviour. We wouldn't say it's okay to kill members of our own species because animals do it. Or rape one another because animals do it. Just because something is 'natural' does not make it right.\n\n## Detail - Analytic\n\nThis is a classic example of the Appeal to Nature Fallacy\n\n\u003e [The Appeal to Nature Fallacy] is the belief that what is natural must be good [...] and that which is unnatural must be bad [...].\n\u003e - Logically Fallacious - Bo Bennet - 2012\n\nEarthquakes are natural, pain is natural, our own death is natural, but just because they are natural does not mean that they are good. Cars are 'unnatural', pain relief is unnatural, food standards and sanitation are unnatural, but that does not mean they are bad.  \n\n## Detail - Emotive\n\nTied up in this argument is often the idea that vegans are 'disconnected from the harsh realities of the world' or 'too weak to do what's necessary'. The actual fact is that veganism stems from a _very real_ understanding of what it means to eat meat. Vegan documentaries are full of footage from slaughterhouses and factory farms, places that people who eat meat typically never see let alone visit. \n\nIt is hard to imagine anything more 'disconnected from the harsh realities of the world' than taking a plastic package of meat and consuming it without ever having even _thought_ of the animal which it came from.\n\n\n",

Everyone is allowed their own opinion even if you don't agree with it \n2. My opinion informs my actions through choice\n3. My actions, choices, and opinions should all be afforded the same level of acceptance\n\nThis takes a freedom of thought/speech type model and applies it to actions under the guise of 'choice'. And it works intuitively because there are scenarios in which this makes sense!\n\n- It's my choice to drop out of uni\n- It's my choice to dye my hair\n- It's my choice to spend all my money on a holiday instead of saving it for a house\n\nThe key thing that these scenarios have in common, and the necessary component for them to have the freedom of speech/thought model applied to them, is that their repercussions apply only to the person making the choice. Compare this with:\n\n- It's my choice to set your house on fire\n- It's my choice to spend all your money on a holiday\n- It's my choice to kick your shins\n\nWhen the opinion \"I think it would be a good thing to set your house on fire\", which we may not agree with or even respect, is transformed into an action that affects someone other than the person that who holds that opinion, it loses its protection.  \n\nYou may think what you like, and do what you like, so long as it only affects you.\n\nEating meat _incontrovertibly_ affects others. It is unavoidable that an animal dies in order to produce meat. You *cannot* use a defence grounded in freedom of thought to justify killing. If you demand respect for your choice to kill something else purely because your choice demands respect, you need to provide an argument as to why the same respect should not be given to some-one who wishes to kill you.",

[p7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w)\n\nIt appears that the 46% figure is taken by using the total tonnage figures of Table 1 [p7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w) and applying the following formula.  \n\n\u003e N type tonnage * Percentage of N tonnage that is nets / Total tonnage = Percentage of total that is nets  \n\u003e 41,376 * 86% / 78,909 = 45%  \n\nWhich... is not quite 46% but it seems reasonable that we are subject to a rounding error here given we do not have the original numbers in full fidelity.  \n\n### Methodology\n\nThe study combines observations from vessel expeditions with satellite imaging [p2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w) to draw conclusions about the overall composition of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch by sampling a smaller area. Their methodology is essentially gathering all the plastic from a sample area, weighing the various types of plastic in that area is, and then multiplying those weights by the total size of the GPGP.\n\n### The majority of the rest\n\nThe National Geographic article cites 46% and then goes on to say \"the majority of the rest [is] composed of fishing industry gear\".  \nThe closest to a supporting statement for this in the study is:  \n\n\u003e  [W]e predominantly observed debris originated from marine sources [p5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w)  \n\nWhich is expanded upon later with: \n\n\u003e  [A]t least half of the collected GPGP plastics was composed of objects from marine based sources, while the relative source amplitudes considered in our model predicted that mass contributions from land-based plastics, even though lower than global average, would still dominate in these ofshore environments. This discrepancy could be due to diferences in the magnitude of certain removal processes between land-based and marine-based plastics that were not accounted for in our models. We trust that beaching is one of these processes as it may primarily remove plastics that are discarded in coastal environments through wave, tidal and onshore winds transport. Nonetheless, the GPGP dominance of marine-sourced plastics could also be attributed to their purposely engineered durability in the marine environment (e.g. strong and thick-walled nets, traps, ropes, and foats used by marine industries) as well as overestimations of land-based sources and/or underestimations of marine-based sources. [p12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w)  \n\nSo although 'at least half' are from marine sources, this _may_ be because land sources of plastic are more likely to wash up, _or_ because plastic from the land breaks up more easily as it's not designed to survive in the sea unlike marine plastics.  \nIn other words, while more than half of the observable plastic in the GPGP is from marine sources, that doesn't mean that most of the plastic going into the ocean is from marine sources.\n\n\n# Sources\n\n- [National Geographic - The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Isn’t What You Think it Is - March 2018](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/03/great-pacific-garbage-patch-plastics-environment/)\n- [Nature - Evidence that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is rapidly accumulating plastic - March 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w)\n",

In the graph it suggests that it takes 70-80L of water per 200ml of Almond Milk. Taking the middle point (75L) that gives us **375L** of water to produce 1L of Almond Milk (or 99 US Gallons per litre).  \n\nTo understand this figure better I reached out to Joseph Poore via email and ze explained that zir figures were based on an confidential Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) from an almond milk production company and based on that LCA confirmed that:\n\n\u003e [I used] the post-farm data for soymilk (almond milk processing isn’t a major user of water, so this is a good proxy)  \n\u003e - Joseph Poore - Email to Author - 2019\n\nJoseph also pointed out that there was a huge difference in the footprint between US and European sourced almonds because the Floridian almonds sourced in the US are predominantly irrigated and the Spanish almonds sourced in Europe and rainfed. For the statistics in the BBC article ze took global data for almond water usage.\n\n\n## Almond Milk vs. Cow Milk Life Cycle Assessment - Jacqueline Ho, Ingrid Maradiaga, et al. - 2016\n\nThis figure is the average of two calculations, one partly based on an industry analysis and one wholly based on a statistical model. The former is as follows:\n\n\u003e Almond production + almond processing =  \n\u003e 0.20113 kgal + 1.068555 kgal = 1.269685 kgal water / 1L almond milk  \n\u003e [Almond Milk vs. Cow Milk Life Cycle Assessment - 2016 - p13](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf)\n\nThe first figure of 201 gallons per litre of almonond milk (consumed in the growing of the almonds) is derived from [Almond Eco­Efficiency Analysis (BASF Corporation, 2011)](http://www.nsfturkey.com/newsroom_pdf/Almond_EEA_Study_Verification_Final_August_2011.pdf). The second figure of 1,068 gallons per 1 litre of Almond milk (consumed in the processing of almonds into milk) is the vast majority of the total and is rather suspect. \n\n### Almond Processing Figure\nDue to a lack of statistical data regarding almond processing, the almond processing figure (1,068 gallons of water to 1 litre of almond milk) is derived using the ratio of water usage in soybean production to soybean processing. [p11](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf).\n\nThe ratio of water usage in producing vs processing soybeans came out as 0.83x  [p11](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf) (i.e. producing the soybeans took 0.83x as much water as processing them). \n\nIt seems very strange to use a ratio of water to grow vs water to process for this, as just because almonds take more water to grow, it does not follow that they take more to process.  It seems far more likely (without evidence to the contrary) that the amount of water to process soybeans is _broadly_ similar. The amount of water used to process soybeans they cite is 136 gallons [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf). It seems staggering to believe that almonds use more than 8x as much water for processing as soybeans without any additional details on the process.\n\nThis ratio of 0.83x is then applied to 0.885 kgal for farming.  \n\n\u003e 0.82822086 = Tree nut farming / x  \n\u003e 0.82822086 = 0.885 kgal / x  \n\u003e x = 1.068555 kgal water used in processing almonds into almond milk  \n\u003e - [p13](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf) \n\nThis gives us the 1,068 gallons of water used in the processing of almonds into milk to yield to 1 litre of milk.\nBut where does the 0.885 kgal come from?\n\nThe 0.885 kgal figure was calculated using the [EIOCLA US 2002 Benchmark Producer Price Model - Tree Nut Farming](http://www.eiolca.net/cgi-bin/dft/display.pl?hybrid=no\u0026first_level_sector=-1\u0026second_level_sector=111335\u0026newmatrix=US430CIDOC2002\u0026key=7216147368\u0026value=0244216612\u0026incdemand=0.0000017858\u0026selectvect=water\u0026select_button1=Run+Model) with an input of the average retail price of almond milk per litre (1.7858$/litre) [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf). The EIOCLA is a rather clever statistical model that uses data from [a variety of public sources](http://www.eiolca.net/docs/full-document-2002-042310.pdf) to calculate the environmental impact of various industries per million dollars of the _producer_ price. \n\nTo be clear, they are using data on the amount of water it takes to grow (produce) nuts to infer the amount of water it takes to process the (already grown) nuts into milk\n\nThe dollar value input for the EIOCLA model is naturally crucial, and the tutorial for the calculator warns:\n\n\u003e The dollar value entered represents producer price - the cost to make the output; it is not the consumer price - the cost to purchase the output. For an average automobile, the producer price is around $20,000. A consumer would purchase this average vehicle for $25,000 to $30,000.  \n\u003e - [EICLA Tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20190606115219/http://www.eiolca.net/tutorial-new/tut_3.html)\n\nUnfortunately it seems that in this study, the retail price has been used, inflating the results significantly. The study justifies this by saying:  \n\n\u003e We are assuming that the cost of packaging is negligible thereby allowing us to use the retail price as the economic activity for EIOLCA.  \n\u003e -  [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf)\n\nBut this ignores retail markup, distribution costs, not to mention the fact that the dataset we're working against is for the _Tree Nut Farming_ industry [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf), not the almond _milk_ industry which skews the result due to the farming industry having a much lower 'producer price' (price the farmer/factory sells it at) by virtue of being further back in the value chain.\n\nWe therefore regard the numbers cited here for almond processing as _highly_ suspect due to:  \n\n1. The conflation of retail and producer pricing\n2. The conflation of nut milk producer pricing and nut farming producer pricing\n3. The inference of processing water usage from farming water usage (two **completely** unrelated numbers)\n4. The assumption that the ratio (0.83x) of production (farming) water usage to processing (almonds into milk) water usage from data regarding soybeans somehow applies to almonds.\n\nUsing the datasets and methodologies that the study provides it is impossible to come to a reliable conclusion regarding the total water usage per litre of almond milk.\n\n#### Speculating further\n\nOut of curiousity however, we can use the data the authors provided to make two still unsupportable, but arguably more accurate calculations for water usage per litre of almond milk. \n\n**Use soybeans' processing water usage per litre as a comparison**\n\n\u003e Almond Farming + Soybean Processing = Approximate Total gallons per litre of milk  \n\u003e   0.20113 kgal [p13](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf) + 0.136 kgals [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf) = Approximate Total  \n\u003e Approximate Total = 0.33713 kgals  \n\nSo our total would be 337 gallons of water per litre of almond milk rather than their cited 1,611. This makes the assumption that almond processing takes exactly as much water as soybean processing, but that seems a more defensible assumption than the _wild_ speculation of the figures based on the model. (See the 4 bullet points above for why.)\n\n**Use the [Almond Eco­Efficiency Analysis](http://www.nsfturkey.com/newsroom_pdf/Almond_EEA_Study_Verification_Final_August_2011.pdf) figure with the 0.83 ratio**\n\n\u003e Almond Farming Water Usage / Almond Processing Water Usage = 0.83 [p11](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf))  \n\u003e  0.2 kgals / x = 0.83  \n\u003e  x = 0.24 kgals  \n\u003e Almond Processing Water Usage = 240 gallons\n\nWhich would make our total (Almond Farming + Almond Processing): 0.44 kgallons, or 440 gallons of water to make 1 litre of almond milk rather than the cited 1,611 gallons.\n\n**Important:** The calculation above is still completely spurious and is merely an extrapolation based on the article's own unfounded assumption of a universally applicable ratio between farming water usage and processing water usage.\n\n\n# Sources\n\n- [The Guardian - Ditch the almond milk: why everything you know about sustainable eating is probably wrong - 2018](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/05/ditch-the-almond-milk-why-everything-you-know-about-sustainable-eating-is-probably-wrong)\n- [Almond Milk vs. Cow Milk Life Cycle Assessment - 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf)\n- [EICLA Tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20190606115219/http://www.eiolca.net/tutorial-new/tut_3.html)\n- [EIOCLA US 2002 Benchmark Producer Price Model - Tree Nut Farming](http://www.eiolca.net/cgi-bin/dft/display.pl?hybrid=no\u0026first_level_sector=-1\u0026second_level_sector=111335\u0026newmatrix=US430CIDOC2002\u0026key=7216147368\u0026value=0244216612\u0026incdemand=0.0000017858\u0026selectvect=water\u0026select_button1=Run+Model)\n- [Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers - Poore and Nemecek - 2018](http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/rapidpdf/360/6392/987?ijkey=ffyeW1F0oSl6k\u0026keytype=ref\u0026siteid=sci) via [josephpoore.com](https://josephpoore.com/)\n- [BBC News - Climate change: Which vegan milk is best? - 2019](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46654042)",

Mato Grosso: State of Destruction - 2009 - p15](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/research/amazon-cattle-footprint-mato/). However, the article itself seems to provide no breakdown, nor even mention of the 630 sample areas, or 12 sample areas being in soy cultivation. The stat actually seems to come from a [press release from Abiove](http://www.abiove.com.br/english/sustent/bs_edicao015_abr09_us.pdf) (see below).\n\nHowever, the metanalysis goes on to conclude   \n\n\u003e The proximate cause of deforestation in the Legal Amazon was predominantly the expansion of pasture, and not of soybeans. However, in Mato Grosso, an increase in soybeans occurred in regions previously used for pasture, which may have displaced pastures further north into the forested areas, causing indirect deforestation there. Therefore, soybean cultivation may still be one of the major underlying causes of deforestation in the Legal Amazon.  \n\n\u003e  - [Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon - April 2010 ](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/2/024002/meta)\n\nThis does not provide any stats however, so we are ultimately no closer to validating the 70% figure other to conclude that the research available at the time of the New Yorker suggested that: \n\n\u003e [R]ecent deforestation in the Legal Amazon was predominantly due to cattle ranching (Morton et al 2006, Brown et al 2005, Greenpeace-Brazil 2009), and not soybean expansion.  \n\u003e  - [Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon - April 2010](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/2/024002/meta)\n\n## Nature - David M. Lapola, Luiz A.

The amount of meal consumed by ton is 77% of the total soybean production globally. Assuming that only trace amounts of soybean meal is used for anything other than animal feed (as suggested by Mr Ash, an expert in the field), we can rest our figure for animal feed consumption at 77% of total global soybean production.\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Global Forest Atlas - Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies](https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/land-use/soy)\n- [Greenpeace - Eating up the Amazon](http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/research/eating-up-the-amazon/)\n- [State of the World 2006 - Worldwatch Institute](https://archive.org/details/stateofworld200600nier)\n- [USDA’s Production, Supply and Distribution Database](https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/app/index.html#/app/advQuery)\n- [World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates Reports](https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/index.htm) \n- [World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates - May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190618093258/https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/3t945q76s/7s75dn66b/f1881w33j/wasde0519.pdf)\n- [SoyaTech - Soya Facts - 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20170112075924/http://www.soyatech.com/soy_facts.htm",

As with any diet, it is possible to become nutritionally deficient on a vegan diet if it's not suitably varied, supplemented, or if there are additional health concerns.  \nIf you have any questions about planning your diet, seek out the expertise of a registered dietician or appropriate health professional as licenced in your country.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [American Dietetic Association](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)\n- [NHS UK](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/healthy-eating-vegetarians-vegans/)\n- [Vegan Society on Nutrition](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health)\n- [British Dietetic Association - Vegan Society Memorandum](https://www.bda.uk.com/about/workwithus/bda_and_vegan_society_mou)\n- [British Dietetic Association - Plant Based Diets](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/plant-based_diet)\n- [WHO - Feeding and nutrition of infants and young children](http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/98302/WS_115_2000FE.pdf)\n- [WHO - Infant and young child feeding](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/infant-and-young-child-feeding)",

Because we don’t store amino acids, our bodies make them in two different ways: either from scratch, or by modifying others. Nine amino acids [...] known as the essential amino acids, must come from food.   \n\u003e - [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)\n\nA concern sometimes levied against plant protein is that it's not 'complete'. \n\n\u003e plant-based foods [..] often lack one or more essential amino acid. Those who abstain from eating animal-based foods can eat a variety of protein-containing plant foods each day in order to get all the amino acids needed to make new protein, and also choose to incorporate complete plant proteins like quinoa and chia seeds.   \n\u003e - [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)\n\nThis means that variety is key in a vegan diet (as in any diet), to ensure you get a complete source of proteins.\n\nThe same (non-vegan) Harvard source even goes on to recommend plant protein sources over animal ones.\n\n\u003e Get your protein from plants when possible. Eating legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, whole grains, and other plant-based sources of protein is a win for your health and the health of the planet. If most of your protein comes from plants, make sure that you mix up your sources so no “essential” components of protein are missing. The good news is that the plant kingdom offers plenty of options to mix and match.   \n\u003e - [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)\n\n\n##  Resources\n- [USDA Nutrition Database](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list)\n- [Challenge 22](https://challenge22.com/)\n- [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)",

Drinking water for the animals, service water and feed mixing water account only for 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.03%, respectively.\n\nTheir primary source is [Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2010)](https://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Hoekstra-2014-Water-for-animal-products_1.pdf)\n\n# Criticisms\n\n## Comparison\nThe statistic above citing water usage is relatively meaningless without the context of what the alternative consumes.\nFortunately the [Waterfootprint.org](https://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/product-water-footprint/water-footprint-crop-and-animal-products/) article allows us to contrast on a litre-to-calorie basis, which shows that cereals (e.g. wheat, oats, barley, etc.) require 0.51 litres per kilocalorie in contrast to beef's 10.19, and chicken's 3 litres.\n\n## Grass fed meat\nAs the statistic above shows the _vast_ majority of the water consumption for animal products comes from producing the feed, carnists will often try to discredit it on the basis that it does not apply as 'water consumption' when animals are eating grass on naturally occuring plains.\n\nThe rebuttal from [Eishel, Gordon, et al.](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/33/11996.full) is worth quoting here.\n\n\u003e A possible objection to the [conclusion that beef uses 160x more land than potatoes/wheat/rice] is that beef production partly relies on pastureland in the arid west[ern United States], land that is largely unfit for any other cultivation form. [... T]he objection ignores other societal benefits those arid lands may provide, notably ecosystem services and biodiversity. It further ignores the ≈0.16 million km2 of high-quality cropland used for grazing and the ≈0.46 million km2 of grazing land [..] that can thus be diverted to food production. Even when focusing only on agricultural land, beef still towers over the other categories. This can be seen by excluding pasture resources and summing only crops and processed roughage (mostly hay and silage, whose production claims prime agricultural land that can be hypothetically diverted to other crops). After this exclusion, 1 Mcal of beef still requires ≈15 m2 land (Fig. 2A), about twofold higher than the second least-efficient [animal product] category.\n\nIn simpler terms:  \n\n1. Even if you exclude the land the cattle grazes on it uses 15 square metres of land per thousand calories to raise beef due to the harvested hay and silage (compacted grass feed). \n2. Removing the cattle from the pastureland would promote biodiversity even if it was unsuitable for growing crops.\n3. There are 0.62 _million_ square kilometeres (which is slightly larger than then entirety of France) of pastureland that are suitable for crops in the United States.\n4. We don't _need_ beef, or any other animal products to shore up our calorie or protein intake, as [acre for acre plants are on average 100 to 160 times more efficient]({{\u003cref \"/facts/land-usage.md\"\u003e}}).\n\nThe stats from the quote cite land usage, but the argument stands (though the numbers differ) for water usage.\n\n\n## Citations\n - [Eishel, Gordon, et al. \"Land, irrigation water, greenhouse gas, reactive nitrogen burdens of meat, eggs and dairy production in the United States\".

Animals are killed/stunned using methods such as electrocution, masceration, and asphyixation in a Co2 chamber, which if you want to beleive this is a humane method we suggest watching the first 15 minutes of [Dominion]({{\u003c ref \"/vegan-culture/documentaries\"\u003e}}).  \nAdditionally the stunning methods are often ineffective (see below for stats for each method). \n\n## Slaughter \u0026 Stunning Methods\n\n### Captive bolt\n\nWith this slaughter method, a 'gun' fires a metal bolt into the brain of the animal causing it to lose consciousness. This is typically used on larger animals (e.g. cows) and is fallible due to the accuracy required and the movement of the panic-stricken animals making precision difficult. According to a 2013 study: \n\n\u003e Inadequate stunning occurred in 12.5% [of cases]  \n\u003e - [Assessment of stun quality at commercial slaughter in cattle shot with captive bolt  - S Atkinson, A Velarde, B Algers - 2013 - p476](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/760f/630e835608a203f552c1ded7f7370ca02536.pdf).\n\nGiven the study was conducted with a observer present one would assume this represents a best case scenario as well, as the slaughterhouse workers will be trying to give their best impressions to comply with EU regulations.\n\nThis means that more than one in ten cattle went to be 'stuck' fully conscious, on top of the experience of queueing up to be slaughtered.\n\n### Electrical\n\nFor medium-sized animals (pigs, sheep, calves), this is performed through 'tongs' placed on either side of the animals head in order to pass a current through the brain and render them temporarily unconscious. In some cases, it can also be applied to the animal's heart in order to provide a lethal shock. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\nFor chickens, this takes the form of an 'electric bath', where chickens are hung upside down by their legs and forced into an electrified vat of water to stun them, prior to their throats being slit by a rotating blade. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\nAccording to a 2009 study conducted in Holland:\n\n\u003e Based on the observed differences in technical settings (V, Hz), and between animal differences in impedance and between animal differences in sensitivity, it is highly probable that large numbers of birds are inadequately stunned during current usage of the water bath technique in slaughterhouses.  \n\u003e - [Electrical water bath stunning of poultry.

Estimates have been made for non-reporting countries as well as for countries reporting incomplete data.

All data shown relate to total meat production, that is, from both commercial and farm\nslaughter. Data are given in terms of dressed carcass weight, excluding offal and slaughter fats.   \n\u003e The compilation of the data domain has been made possible by the cooperation of\ngovernments, which have supplied most of the information in the form of replies to annual\nFAO questionnaires.   \n\u003e - [FAO Methodology Document](http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/documents/QL/QL_methodology_e.pdf)\n\nTwo pieces of this are slightly confusing:  \n\n\u003e  The data on livestock numbers are intended to cover all domestic animals irrespective of their age and the place or purpose of their breeding.  \n\nThis appears to refer to a separate dataset than the one we're inspecting, i.e. 'Live animals'.  \n\n\u003e Data are given in terms of dressed carcass weight, excluding offal and slaughter fats.   \n\nAgain, this refers to a separate set of statistics within the same dataset which refer to tonnes of animal flesh, not our statistics which are 'per head'.\n\n\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [BiteSizeVegan - Quantifying Suffering, Cruelty by the Numbers](http://www.bitesizevegan.org/bite-size-vegan-nuggets/qa/quantifying-suffering-cruelty-by-the-numbers/)\n\n\n",

In 'carrying capacity' there is thus a range from at least 20 to 1.  \n\u003e - Land Usage and Food Production - Stamp, L.D. - Hunger: Can It Be Averted? - 1961 - p38\n\nIt is *not even vegan* because it includes fish (as per the 'together with oceans' comment).\n\nWhile there is no explicit citation, there is a note at the end of the article saying that 'Stamp, L. Dudley - Our Developing World, Faber, 1960' treats many of the topics mentioned above in more detail.\n\n## Stamp, L. Dudley - Our Developing World, Faber, 1960\n\n\u003e On each acre of farmed land - essentially on a dietary base of rice, double or treble cropped where possible, beans, sweet potatoes and other high Calorie foods - Japan can produce 6 or 7 [Standard Nutrition Units] or support that number of people per acre. Under American conditions, and with a meat-milk-fruit diet essentially extravagant of land, it takes some 2 1/2 acres or more to produce one SNU or support one person. It [sic] we then wish to stimulate an argument we can then say Japanese agriculture is 15 to 18 times as efficient as American!  \n\u003e - Stamp, L. Dudley - Our Developing World - 1960 - p113\n\nAnd here we have our original source. This page cites numbers from a table on the next page (p114)\n\n\u003e USA: 175 million population, 3.5 acres cultivated land per capita, 0.4 SNU per acre  \n\u003e Japan: 91.5 million population, 0.15 acres cultivated land per capita, 6.5 SNU per acre  \n\u003e  - Paraphrased version of table on p114 of Stamp, L. Dudley - Our Developing World \n\nAccording to the table 0.4 people can be supported by an acre of cultivated land in the USA (i.e. it takes 2.5 acres to support one person) and 6.5 people can be supported per acre in Japan (i.e it takes 1/6th of an acre to support one person)\n\nAlthough the table does not directly cite its sources elsewhere Dudley uses numbers on total food production from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation from 1948-1952 (referenced in tables on p72-p77) and the total cultivated land acreage from the UN FAO's 'Yearbook' from 1957 (referenced in tables on p40-p41).\n\nI believe zis calculation went approximately as follows:  \n\n\u003e country: total_harvest_calories / 1 SNU (1,000,000 calories) / total_cultivated_acreage = number_of_people_diet_feeds_per_acre  \n\u003e USA: ? (not cited) / 1,000,000 / 192,500,000 (inferred) = 0.4  \n\u003e Japan: ? (not cited) / 1,000,000 / 13,725,000 (inferred) = 6.5  \n\u003e - Paraphrased version of table on p114 of Stamp, L. Dudley - Our Developing World \n\nSo the 'vegan diet' which takes 1/6th of an acre is arrived at by dividing the total calorie production of Japan immediately post WWII by the number of acres of cultivated land and then further dividing that by the number of calories it takes in a year to support one person.  \nAnd the 'meat diet' of 3.5 acres seems to have been a rounded up version of the same calculation for the United States.  \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe 18-20 times land usage statistic _specifically_ is pretty untenable to quote so simplistically today for the following reasons:\n\n1. Comparing \"average diets\" is complex due to the huge variety in what people eat globally and even within the same country.\n2. This specific stat originally referred not to an average vegan diet but the average *Japanese* diet immediately post WWII\n3. The Japanese diet obviously included _fish_ and almost certainly included at least _some_ meat.\n4. Comparing meat and vegetable sources for efficiency needs to be heavily caveated with the regions the statistics were gathered from and the time period those statistics cover as these vary by region and year.\n5. The source for the food production stats are from the period 1948-1950.\n6. The original source does not unpack its exact calculations.\n7. There are much better, *much* more recent statistics we can draw upon.\n\nWe would suggest a much more supportable statement would be \n\n\u003e Beef consumed in the United States requires around 160x as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice for the same number of calories, and nearly 100x as much land for the same amount of protein.  \n\u003e - TalkVeganToMe \n\nThis information is based on the other source, 'Eishel, Gordon et al.' which you can find the details of below.\n\n### Eishel, Gordon, et al.\n\n\u003e Compared with the average resource intensities of [potatoes, wheat, and rice] per megacalorie, beef requires 160, 8, 11, and 19 times as much land, irrigation water, [GreenHouse Gas], and [Nitrogen Fertilizer], respectively, whereas the four nonbeef animal categories require on average 6, 0.5, 2, and 3 times as much, respectively.\n\u003e -  [Eishel, Gordon, et al. \"Land, irrigation water, greenhouse gas, reactive nitrogen burdens of meat, eggs and dairy production in the United States\". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Vol. 111 No. 33 June 2014](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/33/11996.full)\n\nIn simple terms, the above paragraph states that beef requires 160 times as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice per 1,000 calories. The paper does _not_ make any claims regarding the overall efficiency of an 'average' vegan or vegetarian diet with the variety of plants required to make up a nutritionally complete (not to mention interesting) diet, but the numbers are pretty staggering nonetheless.\n\nAlthough not stated in so many words, they also provide the same statistics per kg of protein which shows that **beef takes almost 100 times** (98.2x precisely) as much land as rice, potatoes, or wheat to provide the same amount of protein.  \n\nThis is calculated by dividing the mean beef kg protein per square metre\n[Eishel Gordon Et Al Supporting Information Sheet \u003e Dataset S1 Excel Spreadsheet \u003e PartitioningPerProtein](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2014/07/19/1402183111.DCSupplemental/pnas.201402183SI.pdf) and dividing it by the average of rice, wheat, and potatoes' kg protein square metre numbers. You can see in the PartitioningPerCalorie sheet that this is the same calculation performed for their 160x as much land per calorie quote.\n\n### Possible Objections\n\nThe article also goes on to address the possible objection of the numbers being 'inflated' by the cattle grazing land which is otherwise unsuitable for cultivation.\n\n\u003e A possible objection to the above conclusion is that beef production partly relies on pastureland in the arid west[ern United States], land that is largely unfit for any other cultivation form. [... T]he objection ignores other societal benefits those arid lands may provide, notably ecosystem services and biodiversity. It further ignores the ≈0.16 million km2 of high-quality cropland used for grazing and the ≈0.46 million km2 of grazing land [..] that can thus be diverted to food production. Even when focusing only on agricultural land, beef still towers over the other categories. This can be seen by excluding pasture resources and summing only crops and processed roughage (mostly hay and silage, whose production claims prime agricultural land that can be hypothetically diverted to other crops). After this exclusion, 1 Mcal of beef still requires ≈15 m2 land (Fig. 2A), about twofold higher than the second least-efficient [animal product] category.\n\nIn simple terms, even if you exclude the land the cattle grazes on it uses 15 square metres of land per thousand calories to raise beef (36.5 times as much as potatoes)! Potatoes by comparison use 0.41 square metres per thousand calories - [Referenced Supporting Information PDF - S19](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2014/07/19/1402183111.DCSupplemental/pnas.201402183SI.pdf).\n\n# Alternative Presentations\n\nThese same statistics can be found in a myriad of different forms, you can find some of them below.\n\n## A Well Fed World - Why we need plant based approaches\nA Well Fed World in Collaboration with Plantrician Project produced a graphic which states:  \n\n\u003e [On a] standard American diet: 2 football fields (1.3 acres each) feeds 1 person per year  \n\u003e [On a] plant based diet: 2 football fields feeds 14 people per year\n\nThis originates from [Plantrician Project - Food Math 101](https://web.archive.org/web/20190103163621/https://plantricianproject.org/food-math-101)\n\n## Plantrician Project - Food Math 101\n\n\u003e In order to produce the Standard American Diet (SAD), heavily comprised of animal protein and dairy, it’s estimated that the equivalent of 2 football fields are required per person per year—with much of this allocated to growing the crops to feed the animals.

What's that about!\nLots of updates, that's what that's about!\n\nFirst let's start with what we aimed to achieve from the last newsletter:  \n\n1. ✅ Add an expanded category section rather than forcing people to scroll through categories (currently the articles towards the end of the scroll list just don't get seen!)\n1. ✅ Add favourites to allow you to easily access pages\n1. ✅ Fix bug that causes you to scroll back to the top of the page\n1. ✅ Improve search so that it's faster\n1. ✅ Improve search so that it will match pages that don't contain 100% of the words.\n1. ✅ Highlight new articles on the main page\n1. ✅ Add a Random Article button (Kinda, I just randomised the display on the front page!)\n1. ✅Next/Previous articles on the bottom of each article page\n\n100% Success rate! Love it.  \nIn addition to that I've:\n\n1. Added alert notifications of new articles\n1. Added prompt to rate the app (will help app store rankings massively)\n1. Added iPad Support\n1. Added iOS 10.3 support (previously 12.2+ was required!)\n1. Made the prompt to enable analytics prettier\n1. Fixed a bug where swapping between apps would scroll you back to the top of the page\n1. Fixed a memory leak (improved performance)\n1. Improved handling of settings updates (stopped it erasing your back button/location unnecessarily\n\nAnd I've also added automated functional testing which you can see in action here: [https://imgur.com/a/LXPD4Qo](https://imgur.com/a/LXPD4Qo)\n\nAt the time of writing notifications and prompt-to-rate are not available in the Apple App Store, only on Google Play as I finished the submission on Friday evening so it will be Monday before it's available on iOS!\nWhat's Next\nMarketing and Content!\nThe main features I wanted for the app are now done so barring any bugfixes that need to happen I can focus on getting people to use the app by cross-posting it across the internet.\n\nAs for content, the articles I'm going to start with are:\nTofu contains Estrogen \nPlants feel pain\n\nIf you've got any other articles you'd like to see, just let me know. You can see what I'm working on here: [https://trello.com/b/7ecEPfjW/talkvegantome-content]( https://trello.com/b/7ecEPfjW/talkvegantome-content)\n\nHave a great week everyone!\n\n# TalkVeganToMe - #10 - 25/08/19\n\nThis week has been an absolute rollercoaster!\nOn Sunday I had the app cleaned up enough to be ready to submit it again for approval, just to test the waters and see if it would be possible to release as a content only app (i.e. without additional functionality). \nOn Tuesday, I got another rejection, which annoyed me somewhat due to there being multiple similar apps out there and an entire reference section of the app store, but ultimately it was what I was expecting.\nI started to get quite excited about building a ingredients scanning feature into the app using AWS's text recognition API, and then having those snapshots and ingredients missing in the database appear in a \"vegan or not\" section of the app where people could swipe through photos of packaging and swipe left/right tinder style on whether they were vegan or not.\n\nTHE NEXT DAY THE APP GOT APPROVED\n\nI was in shock, I'd replied to the rejection asking for some feedback on what needed changing given it was similar to other apps that were already on the app store, but given that I waited 3 weeks for a response to my appeal last time it got rejected, I was genuinely not expecting any response at all. Let alone for it to be approved within 24hrs. BUT IT IS FINALLY LIVE!\n\n**Apple App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/talkvegantome/id1463279026](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/talkvegantome/id1463279026)  \n**Android Play Store:** [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.talkvegantome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.talkvegantome)\n\nThe UK Vegans discord people were the first to find out and gave a bunch of five star reviews on both app stores which is unbelievably helpful and I'm so grateful for their positive feedback the last few days.\n\nI also happened to notice a post on Reddit distributing an infographic that was based on the ancient land-usage data that I chimed in on to provide a better citation for, and which caused the first bit of social media exposure for the app!\n\nThere are a few more things I want to tidy up before I give it a proper social media push though:\n\n1. Add an expanded category section rather than forcing people to scroll through categories (currently the articles towards the end of the scroll list just don't get seen!)\n1. Add favourites to allow you to easily access pages\n1. Fix bug that causes you to scroll back to the top of the page\n1. Improve search so that it's faster\n1. Improve search so that it will match pages that don't contain 100% of the words.\n1. Highlight new articles on the main page\n1. Add a Random Article button\n1. Next/Previous articles on the bottom of each article page\n\nI think you get the theme here, navigation is a problem right now and content discovery is an even bigger one. Fortunately I don't think any of these are particularly hard work, I'm just going to struggle to find the time to spend on them for the next few weeks!\n\nThank you all so much for your support and ideas for the app until its release, I couldn't have done it without you.\n\nBut this is just the beginning. After this first push to clean up the app I want to focus back on content again and create more new articles that I'm as excited about as the ones I've written so far! And at some point I want to add the ingredients scanning too but... I mustn't get ahead of myself. I want the app to stand on its own legs with regards to content first.\n\nI'm SO FUCKING EXCITED everyone! I will still keep you all up to date every week just so I don't burst with excitement!\n\n# TalkVeganToMe - #9 - 18/08/19\n\nSo this week has been pretty productive.\nAs you've probably seen if you've opened the app recently there has been a complete overhaul of the interface including search!\n\n[Image 1](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/7efbe101e4e479517a32c8738/images/02c2705f-2c96-4dd9-9d19-fab61dfa14ac.png)  \n[Image 2](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/7efbe101e4e479517a32c8738/images/99f6959c-5069-4fc3-a94f-07b31dc91dd6.png)\n\nIf any of you have downloaded some of the beta updates for the Android app you will have noticed some pretty abysmal performance, particularly in search. Thankfully this has now been resolved, and the latest beta update (which is still working its way through the playstore release process) will be reflect these fixes and should be available soon.\n\nAs for next week, my availability is pretty limited but I'm going to be working mainly on tidying up the code and trying to get a release approved on the Apple App Store!\n\nWish me luck! And send feedback!!!\n\n# TalkVeganToMe - #8 - 10/08/19\n\nErm... Not going to lie there has not been a lot of progress in the weeks since my last email.  \nIf you recall, last time I wrote, the app had just been rejected from the app store and I was awaiting a response to my appeal.  \nThat was on the 20th of July, and here we are three weeks later and there has been no response at all from apple. Not even a confirmation email. I would have started to doubt that I'd even successfully sent the appeal apart from the fact that I printed the confirmation page to a pdf which explicitly states:   \nPlease note that if you self- reject or resubmit your binary in App Store Connect, your appeal will not be reviewed and this request will be canceled.\n\nWhich basically means there's no recourse or follow up, or ability to find out if they've just chucked it in the bin. I'm pretty annoyed about this because with my lack of experience with app development I don't actually know what will meet the threshold for them to allow the app on the app store. I could put another 3 months work into it and still get rejected because there's no communication about what exactly their rules are beyond some vague description of \"meaningfully different from a mobile browsing experience\". \n\nIn any case, I've been buoyed by the response from some of you suggesting new app designs to make it easier to use, and today finally got out of my rut with a flash of motiviation and frantically sketched out a new design for the app.\n\nYou can see that here: [New App Design Sketch](https://imgur.com/a/RsW63YR)\n \n(As you can tell I'm no artist.)\n\nSo I'm going to start working on that over the next few weeks, and will keep you all posted on how it goes.\n\nThe main new features will be:\n\n* Complete redesign\n* Left/right scrolling between articles\n* Search\n* Flashcards\n\nAll in all this should improve the usability of the app pretty significantly, and also add some nice features like the search and flash cards which I've been wanting to add anyway.\n\nHopefully that'll be enough to get it through to the app store! Failing that I'll have to do something more drastic!\n\n# TalkVeganToMe - #7 - 13/07/18\n\nThis week has been extremely productive!\n\n## Content\n - Anti Vegan Arguments - WIthout farming there would be no animals\n - Updated the almond milk water usage article to include recent sources\n - Added a linter to flag gendered pronouns to be replaced with ze/zir pronouns (when unsure of persons preferred pronouns)\n - Created a Media Pack page of logos and blurb\n - Added these newsletters to a Blog page\n\n## App changes\n - Added table of contents to the bottom of the page\n - Allowed pages to be displayed only on website (e.g. the media pack)\n - Reskinned the app to look a bit more like the website\n - Submitted the app for review for inclusion on the app store\n\nThat last one is a doozy as... *drumroll* the app got rejected!\n \n\u003e Guideline 4.2.2 - Design - Minimum Functionality  \n\u003e\n\u003e We noticed that your app only includes links, images, or content aggregated from the Internet with limited or no native iOS functionality. Although this content may be curated from the web specifically for your users, since it does not sufficiently differ from a mobile web browsing experience, it is not appropriate for the App Store.\n\nWhich... I can't argue with in a way because it is at its heart, a reference app, and definitely does contain all the content from the website with no additional functionality except the offline mode!  \nThat offline functionality and immediate feedback of the app is utterly critical to the whole concept of TalkVeganToMe. If you're in a pub, talking with your omni friends and mention a stat and get rebutted with \"Where's your source?\" you need to be able to come up with that quickly, easily, and reliably. If you have no internet, you're done. If you have to try and remember the name of the site, type it in, load it, you're done.\nIt's a huge difference between having this content on a website and in the app. The app came first, the website is just secondary so people can link to the content without having to download the app. \n\nAnyway, I've appealed the decision with the above reasons, so it may still get in, but we shall see!\n\nWorst case scenario I'll have to add some additional functionality to the app to make it 'differ sufficiently from a mobile browsing experience'. A few ideas spring to mind  \n\n - Fact flash cards, e.g. Shows an e-number on-screen and you hit vegan/not vegan and get a score based on success.  \n- Debate dialogue trees, an expansion on how the anti-vegan argument pages work right now, except you are presented with an anti-vegan argument, and then given options to choose from to respond with, and then get different responses depending on what you choose (a lot of work).\n\nSome-one also suggested adding in a product barcode scanning feature (to determine whether the product was vegan or not) but gathering the data for that would be a huge amount of work to make it useful for even a small percentage of the globe.\n\nI'm open to ideas! Let me know if you have anything you'd like to see in the app!\n\n# 2019-07-13\n\n## Progress this week\nThis week has actually been extremely productive! I carved out 2 days to focus on the app and do nothing else, which helped immensely. \n\nThe biggest thing is we have a newly skinned website!\n\nhttp://talkveganto.me\n\nThe website was always there, but it looked rather like a corporate intranet so I was hesitant to distribute the address too much. I'd love to say that the design was all my work, but it was thanks to the skill of some-one I hired on Fiverr that we have the design. I just took the design and applied it as a Hugo template.\n\nAdditionally, we also have a number of promotional screenshots designed! Again from some-one on Fiverr. These will go in the App Store page to make it a bit more attractive to people who are just browsing through randomly. You can see these here: https://imgur.com/a/T3mLLAC\n\nAs for articles we have:\n\n- Anti Vegan - It's too weird/counter cultural\n- Anti-Vegan - Animals are slaughtered humanely\n- Anti-Vegan - Animals aren't Sentient/Sapient\n- Facts - Animals slaughtered annually (improved to provide an explanation of how to generate figures from the UN's FAO statistics)\n\nIn fact there's only one article left in the pre-release pool!\n## Roadmap to Release\nPrior to the release I need to do the following\n\n- Write 'Anti Vegan - Without farming there would be no animals'\n- Update Almond Milk Water Usage article with latest stats\n- Proofread all articles!\n- Add tutorial to app to indicate workflow\n- Put a Table of Contents at the bottom of the page in app to make navigation easier\n- Make the app scroll back to the top of the page on navigate to new page\n- Setup talkvegantome.com in addition to .me\n- Create a media pack for the site (logos, blurb, etc.)\nAnd then it's ready to release!\n\nHonestly I'm getting quite excited, the end is in sight after a couple of month's worth of work.\nThe biggest gap currently is the marketing strategy. I think it's going to be quite hard to get the word out as I've had very limited responses to my attempts to reach out to vegan news outlets and influencers. This means I'm going to be relying on word of mouth a lot which... Is unpredictable but probably has a better chance in the vegan community as it's quite well engaged!\n\nWe'll see how it goes. I'm setting my launch expectations low so I won't be sad if it just gets 10 downloads in the first week!\n\nFingers crossed!\n\n# 2019-07-07\n\n## The Saga of 1/6th of an Acre\nI have finally found the original source for the Cowspiracy fact that 1/6th of an acre is required to feed a vegan and 3.5 acres required to feed a meat eater.\nCowspiracy (2014) cites an Earthsave article (2006) which cites a book called Diet for a new America (1987) which cites an article called Proteins (1965) which cites another article called Land Use and Food Production (1961) which cites a book Our Developing World (1960) which cites the 1948-1952 UN FAO statistics on food production to compare a JAPANESE diet (which takes 1/6th of an acre to feed one person) and an American diet (which takes 2.5 acres and got rounded up somewhere along the way).\n\nSo it's not even a vegan diet at all! The much better stat is: Beef consumed in the United States requires around 160x as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice for the same number of calories, and nearly 100x as much land for the same amount of protein. Which is sourced from a 2014 article on comparative land usage.\nOther Progress this Week\n\nI spent quite a lot of time researching the above last week as it required 2-3 trips to the British Library to fetch the ancient articles and books which weren't available anywhere else. I only managed to finish:\n\n- Anti-Vegan Arguments - One Person Can't Make a Difference\n- And made some progress but didn't release\n- Anti-Vegan Arguments - It's Okay to Kill Animals Because They Aren't Sentient/Sapient\n\nWhich is not an argument you see very often I don't think but it one that holds special value to me because it's what I believed before going vegan! \n\n## Contributions this Week\n\nI had two people reach out to me this week with suggestions for content and the app, one in particular being a very detailed set of feedback for app design which was extremely helpful!\nI can't overstate how much it means to hear from people using the app, so please keep reaching out by replying to this email, even if it's just a tiny suggestion or piece of feedback it means a great deal!\nAs always, you can see the pipeline for content on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/7ecEPfjW/talkvegantome-content)!\n\n# 2019-06-29\n\n## The Past Two Weeks\nThe past two weeks have been quiet as expected due to a week's holiday! \nI had secretly hoped to spend some time writing even on holiday, but I think for mental health's sake it's a good thing I didn't.\n\nThis week I've been figuring out how to tackle one of the biggest remaining challenges for content which is the \"Anti Vegan Arguments\" section.\nMy first attempt at this section ended up being merged into the \"Vegan Facts\" section, primarily because the format warranted a clear differentiation between \"analysis of facts\" and \"rebuttal of arguments\" and it didn't make sense to keep them under the same section.\n\nIn creating the new \"rebuttal of arguments\" vision for anti-vegan-arguments I was heavily inspired by Earthling Ed's 30 Non Vegan Excuses. In fact the original scope for this section was to reach out to Ed and ask for permission to redistribute some of the chapters. Since then however I've become more accepting of writing content for the app, and wanted to produce something unique rather than simply reword it. Especially because as the app is community based and editable by anyone, we would either have to lock Ed's chapters as immutable, or allow people to edit them, neither of which seemed good options. \n\nIn writing these pages I wanted to bring as much of the analytic rigor from the fact check pages as I could, and in my first attempt this sent me spiralling down a rabbit hole of analytic philosophy akin to my degree coursework. What the app needed though was not some 10,000 word dense philosophical analysis with a vocabulary only academics could understand, so I settled on a much simpler format that only used citations where absolutely necessary (e.g. for the facts!).\n\nThe ones I've finished so far are:\n\n- No Food is Truly Vegan\n- Personal Choice\n- Animals Eat other Animals\n\nI'm reasonably happy with what I've got so far, continuing with the summary sections at the top and splitting out the detailed analysis further down into Analytic and Emotive arguments, with no judgement intended as to the validity of either section. The purpose of these sections is purely to allow you to tailor your response to the person you're debating.\n\nPrior to release I've committed to finishing rebuttals to the following as well:\n\n- Animals are Slaughtered Humanely\n- Animals aren't 'sentient'\n- Without Farming there would be no animals\n- It's too extreme/weird\n\nIn addition, I still need to take the design from last week and apply it to the website, and get a complete marketing strategy in place. On this aspect I had some positive feedback earlier today from a vegan podcast who said they'd be interested in seeing the app when complete and would mention it as part of the podcast if they liked it, which is great news as so far I've had naff all response from other vegan news sites and influencers.\n\nAnyway, this has run extremely long, hope you've all had a wonderful few weeks and as ever, let me know if you have any ideas for the app, or any comments about the content!\n\nAs always, you can see the pipeline for content on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/7ecEPfjW/talkvegantome-content)!\n\n# 2019-06-15\n\nThis week has been much less productive for a couple of reasons. Firstly I took it as a bit of a self-care week, as I've been spending every waking moment on the app for 2-3 months now!\nSecondly, I was a bit stuck on how to get from where I am to \"released\". I've been enjoying writing articles on facts and their sources, but we have enough for the moment and writing more wouldn't actually get me any closer to released. My vision for TalkVeganToMe was not just a \"vegan snopes\" but a one-stop-shop for quick reference of:\n\n1. Rebuttals to vegan arguments\n2. Ethical purchasing advice\n3. 'Further information\". Books, films, organisations, podcasts, youtube channels\n4. Fact's sources\n\nThe first three are broadly the killer features from an app perspective. My original use case was someone in a shop (me) looking up e-numbers quickly. \nThe fourth however is probably most often going to be used in debates on social media, and not the app at all. The fourth is also probably the most compelling unique selling point. \nThat's when I realised that most likely people's first experiences with TalkVeganToMe is going to be the website, irrespective of much I am in love with the app and want them to use it.\n\nSo I came up with the following path-to-released.\n\n1. Make the website something I'm proud of.\n2. Write rebuttals to vegan arguments\n3. Polish up ethical purchasing advice\n4. Final review of all content's accuracy and legibility\n\nI'm debating adding a fifth:\n\n5. Add a search function to the app and website.\n\nI very much want this to be a feature at some point, but I don't know if it's necessary for release (i.e. if people will take one look at the app and think: unusable). Let me know what you think!\n\nAs an aside, next week is not going to be a super productive one either as I'm on holiday!\n\n\nAs always, you can see the pipeline for content on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/7ecEPfjW/talkvegantome-content)!\n\n# 2019-06-08\n\nThis week has been super productive, focussing pretty much entirely on content and investigating some really interesting stats!\n\nThis week I managed to add \n\n- Facts - Ocean Plastic is mostly nets\n- Facts - Most soy is fed to cattle\n- Facts - WHO, FDA, BDA endorsements for vegan diets\n- Facts - Almond Milk Water Usage\n- Facts - Land Usage\n- Facts - Tofu Causes Deforestation\n- Vegan Lifestyle \u0026 Culture - Defined Documentaries template\n- Vegan Lifestyle \u0026 Culture - Defined and fleshed out Organisations\n\nYou can see the pipeline for content on the Trello board.\n\nSome of these, particularly the Land Usage and Almond Milk Water Usage stats were really fascinating to explore the original sources, and uncovered some pretty egregious misrepresentations of data.\n\n# 2019-06-01\n\nThanks for signing up to the beta and downloading the app. Hopefully you've had a chance to browse around and make sure it works for you.\nProbably the first thing you'll notice is that it is light on content. I'm working hard to rectify this, but as I'm just one person this is subject to my own schedule and may end up being a touch sporadic in updates!\n\nThis week I managed to add:\n\n- Anti-Vegan Arguments - Protein\n- Vegan Statistics - Animal Life Expectancy\n- Vegan Statistics - Animal Slaughter Methods\n- How to contribute\n\nYou can see the pipeline for content on the Trello board.\nI'm always looking for new ideas, especially for stats to add, so just reply to this email with any ideas you've got and I'll add them to the board!\n",
