Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.  \n\u003e\n\u003e - [American Dietetic Association](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)\n\n## NHS\n\n\u003e A vegetarian or vegan diet can be suitable for everyone, regardless of their age.  \n\u003e\n\u003e - [NHS UK](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/healthy-eating-vegetarians-vegans/)\n\n## British Dietetic Association.\nAlthough often cropped to  \n\n\u003e [I]t is possible to follow a well-planned, plant-based, vegan friendly diet that supports healthy living in people of all ages, and during pregnancy and breastfeeding.   \n\nThe full quote is from a memorandum between the BDA and The Vegan Society as below\n\n\u003e As a result of the memorandum the BDA and The Vegan Society will:  \n\u003e - Work together to show that it is possible to follow a well-planned, plant-based, vegan friendly diet that supports healthy living in people of all ages, and during pregnancy and breastfeeding.   \n\u003e - [British Dietetic Association](https://www.bda.uk.com/about/workwithus/bda_and_vegan_society_mou)\n\nTheir [associated fact sheet](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/plant-based_diet) talks about 'Plant Based Diets' which it defines as everything between pescetarianism to veganism.\n\n\u003e A plant-based diet is based on foods derived from plants, [...] with few or no animal products.\n\u003e [...]  \n\u003e Well-planned plant-based diets can support healthy living at every age and life-stage.   \n\u003e\n\u003e - [British Dietetic Association - Plant Based Diets](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/plant-based_diet)\n\nAs their statement refers to plant-based diets (where they mean merely primarily but not necessarily _excusively_ plant-based) the BDA is not quite as quotable as other sources. Nonetheless it appears that they are committed to the idea that a well planned vegan diet is healthy.\n\n## World Health Organisation\n\n\u003e For adults, protein from two or more plant groups daily is like to be adequate. For children, however, and especially those aged 6-24 months, each meal should contain wherever possible two complementary sources of plant protein.  \n\u003e  Vegan diets (those with no source of animal proteins and especially no milk) may have serious adverse effects on infant development and should be discouraged.  \n\u003e [WHO - Feeding and nutrition of infants and young children](http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/98302/WS_115_2000FE.pdf)\n\n----\n\n\u003e WHO and UNICEF recommend:  \n\u003e - exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life; and  \n\u003e - introduction of nutritionally-adequate and safe complementary (solid) foods at 6 months together with continued breastfeeding up to 2 years of age or beyond.  \n\u003e - [WHO - Infant and young child feeding](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/infant-and-young-child-feeding)\n\nTaking these two documents together it seems reasonable to conclude that the WHO endorses the healthfulness of a vegan diet provided the child is breastfed for the first six months.  \nIt is important to remember when discussing this topic that _it is not always possible_ to breastfeed your child and that compassion is critical when talking to vegans who have had to make difficult decisions regarding dietary choices for their infants and children.\n\n## Seeking Nutritional Advice\n\nThe operative words in most of the quotes above are 'well-planned'. As with any diet, it is possible to become nutritionally deficient on a vegan diet if it's not suitably varied, supplemented, or if there are additional health concerns.  \nIf you have any questions about planning your diet, seek out the expertise of a registered dietician or appropriate health professional as licenced in your country.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [American Dietetic Association](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)\n- [NHS UK](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/healthy-eating-vegetarians-vegans/)\n- [Vegan Society on Nutrition](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health)\n- [British Dietetic Association - Vegan Society Memorandum](https://www.bda.uk.com/about/workwithus/bda_and_vegan_society_mou)\n- [British Dietetic Association - Plant Based Diets](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/plant-based_diet)\n- [WHO - Feeding and nutrition of infants and young children](http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/98302/WS_115_2000FE.pdf)\n- [WHO - Infant and young child feeding](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/infant-and-young-child-feeding)",

Because we don’t store amino acids, our bodies make them in two different ways: either from scratch, or by modifying others. Nine amino acids [...] known as the essential amino acids, must come from food.   \n\u003e - [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)\n\nA concern sometimes levied against plant protein is that it's not 'complete'. \n\n\u003e plant-based foods [..] often lack one or more essential amino acid. Those who abstain from eating animal-based foods can eat a variety of protein-containing plant foods each day in order to get all the amino acids needed to make new protein, and also choose to incorporate complete plant proteins like quinoa and chia seeds.   \n\u003e - [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)\n\nThis means that variety is key in a vegan diet (as in any diet), to ensure you get a complete source of proteins.\n\nThe same (non-vegan) Harvard source even goes on to recommend plant protein sources over animal ones.\n\n\u003e Get your protein from plants when possible. Eating legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, whole grains, and other plant-based sources of protein is a win for your health and the health of the planet. If most of your protein comes from plants, make sure that you mix up your sources so no “essential” components of protein are missing. The good news is that the plant kingdom offers plenty of options to mix and match.   \n\u003e - [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)\n\n\n##  Resources\n- [USDA Nutrition Database](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list)\n- [Challenge 22](https://challenge22.com/)\n- [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)",

Drinking water for the animals, service water and feed mixing water account only for 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.03%, respectively.\n\nTheir primary source is [Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2010)](https://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Hoekstra-2014-Water-for-animal-products_1.pdf)\n\n# Criticisms\n\n## Comparison\nThe statistic above citing water usage is relatively meaningless without the context of what the alternative consumes.\nFortunately the [Waterfootprint.org](https://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/product-water-footprint/water-footprint-crop-and-animal-products/) article allows us to contrast on a litre-to-calorie basis, which shows that cereals (e.g. wheat, oats, barley, etc.) require 0.51 litres per kilocalorie in contrast to beef's 10.19, and chicken's 3 litres.\n\n## Grass fed meat\nAs the statistic above shows the _vast_ majority of the water consumption for animal products comes from producing the feed, carnists will often try to discredit it on the basis that it does not apply as 'water consumption' when animals are eating grass on naturally occuring plains.  The trite rebuttal to this is to enquire precisely what percentage of their consumption is grass fed on naturally occuring plains.",

As such we have split this section into groups on a country by country basis.  \n\n## Slaughter \u0026 Stunning Methods\n\n### Captive bolt\nWith this slaughter method, a 'gun' fires a metal bolt into the brain of the animal causing it to lose consciousness. This is typically used on larger animals (e.g. cows) and is fallible due to the accuracy required and the movement of the panic-stricken animals making precision difficult.\n\n### Electrical\n\nFor medium-sized animals (pigs, sheep, calves), this is performed through 'tongs' placed on either side of the animals head in order to pass a current through the brain and render them temporarily unconscious. In some cases, it can also be applied to the animal's heart in order to provide a lethal shock. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\nFor chickens, this takes the form of an 'electric bath', where chickens are hung upside down by their legs and forced into an electrified vat of water to stun them, prior to their throats being slit by a rotating blade. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\n### Gas\n\nAnimals are lowered into a chamber of a high-CO2 mixture for up to five minutes [HSA.org.uk](https://www.hsa.org.uk/gaseous-methods/gaseous-methods) in order to ensure their death.\n\n### Sticking\n\nUsed for larger animals, this is the process of hoisting the animal by the back legs and slicing its neck to sever large arteries to ensure the animal dies of blood loss. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\n# United Kingdom\n\n\u003e Current law requires animals to be stunned before slaughter - rendering them insensible to pain until death supervenes.

To supply one lacto-ovo vegetarian with food for a year requires one-half acre. To supply one pure vegetarian requires only one-sixth of an acre. In other words, a given acreage can feed 20 times as many people eating a pure vegetarian diet-style as it could people eating the standard American diet-style [Diet for a new American p344 as PDF](https://ia802904.us.archive.org/21/items/JohnRobbinsDietForANewAmerica/John_Robbins_Diet_for_a_New_America.pdf)\n\nThis in turn cites \n-  'Frances Moore Lappé, Diet for a Small Planet, 10th ed.

These figures are averages; some plants in each category produce even more. Spinach, for example, can produce up to _twenty six times_ more protein per acre than can beef.  \n\u003e - [Diet for a Small Planet 1991 p10](https://archive.org/details/dietforsmallplan00lapp_2/page/10)\n\nThis gets us no closer to the 1/6th acre citation however!\n\nThe 2002 edition makes few mention of acres, and we were unable to find any comparison of efficiencies to help.

Comparing \"average diets\" is complex due to the huge variety in what people eat globally and even within the same country.\n2. Comparing meat and vegetable sources for efficiency needs to be heavily caveated with the regions the statistics were gathered from and the time period those statistics cover as these vary by region and year.\n3. The source is from 1981 (so far as we can trace it, Frances' source may be even older).\n4. There are much better, much more recent statistics we can draw upon.\n\nWe would suggest a much more supportable statement would be \n\n\u003e Beef requires 160x as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice for the same number of calories, and nearly 100x as much for the same amount of protein.\n\nThis information is based on the other source, 'Eishel, Gordon et al.' which you can find the details of below.\n\n### Eishel, Gordon, et al.\n\n\u003e Compared with the average resource intensities of [potatoes, wheat, and rice] per megacalorie, beef requires 160, 8, 11, and 19 times as much land, irrigation water, [GreenHouse Gas], and [Nitrogen Fertilizer], respectively, whereas the four nonbeef animal categories require on average 6, 0.5, 2, and 3 times as much, respectively.\n\u003e -  [Eishel, Gordon, et al. \"Land, irrigation water, greenhouse gas, reactive nitrogen burdens of meat, eggs and dairy production in the United States\". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Vol. 111 No. 33 June 2014](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/33/11996.full)\n\nIn simple terms, the above paragraph states that beef requires 160 times as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice per 1,000 calories. The paper does _not_ make any claims regarding the overall efficiency of an 'average' vegan or vegetarian diet with the variety of plants required to make up a nutritionally complete (not to mention interesting) diet, but the numbers are pretty staggering nonetheless.\n\nAlthough not stated in so many words, they also provide the same statistics per kg of protein which shows that **beef takes almost 100 times** (98.2x precisely) as much land as rice, potatoes, or wheat to provide the same amount of protein.  \n\nThis is calculated by dividing the mean beef kg protein per square metre\n[Eishel Gordon Et Al Supporting Information Sheet \u003e Dataset S1 Excel Spreadsheet \u003e PartitioningPerProtein](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2014/07/19/1402183111.DCSupplemental/pnas.201402183SI.pdf) and dividing it by the average of rice, wheat, and potatoes' kg protein square metre numbers. You can see in the PartitioningPerCalorie sheet that this is the same calculation performed for their 160x as much land per calorie quote.\n\n### Possible Objections\n\nThe article also goes on to address the possible objection of the numbers being 'inflated' by the cattle grazing land which is otherwise unsuitable for cultivation.\n\n\u003e A possible objection to the above conclusion is that beef production partly relies on pastureland in the arid west[ern United States], land that is largely unfit for any other cultivation form. [... T]he objection ignores other societal benefits those arid lands may provide, notably ecosystem services and biodiversity. It further ignores the ≈0.16 million km2 of high-quality cropland used for grazing and the ≈0.46 million km2 of grazing land [..] that can thus be diverted to food production. Even when focusing only on agricultural land, beef still towers over the other categories. This can be seen by excluding pasture resources and summing only crops and processed roughage (mostly hay and silage, whose production claims prime agricultural land that can be hypothetically diverted to other crops). After this exclusion, 1 Mcal of beef still requires ≈15 m2 land (Fig. 2A), about twofold higher than the second least-efficient [animal product] category.\n\nIn simple terms, even if you exclude the land the cattle grazes on it uses 15 square metres of land per thousand calories to raise beef (36.5 times as much as potatoes)! Poatoes by comparison use 0.41 square metres per thousand calories - [Referenced Supporting Information PDF - S19](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2014/07/19/1402183111.DCSupplemental/pnas.201402183SI.pdf).\n\n\n## Citations\n\n-  [Eishel, Gordon, et al. \"Land, irrigation water, greenhouse gas, reactive nitrogen burdens of meat, eggs and dairy production in the United States\".

A little preparation can go a long way to making the process smoother.\n\nIf you're attending a catered function, contact the organiser if possible and explain the dietary requirements of veganism.\n\n**Important:** Specify No Meat, No Dairy, No Eggs, No Honey. Kind souls may be quick to say they know what veganism means, but all too often the lesser known things (e.g. honey) or even the better known things (e.g milk) get missed.\n\n### Visiting friends and family\n\nThis can be one of the most difficult scenarios to navigate in day to day life as a vegan. People can take food quite personally, and being told that you won't eat their food can elicit a negative reaction.\n\nRemember, what you put in your body is entirely down to you. No matter how other people feel, or what their expectations may be, you do not have to eat or drink anything you do not want to.\n\nGetting this message across in a non-combative way can be challenging. If you have the means, and are willing to go the extra mile to keep the peace, try offering to cook, or bringing a preprepared meal for yourself or for everyone. Alternatively ask whether they can set a small portion of the meal aside that is vegan prior to being combined with the rest of the meal (e.g. side vegatables, rice, dried pasta, etc.).\n\n### Organising a meal\n\nWhether at home, or in a restaurant, this can be one of the most rewarding activism experiences as it provides an opportunity to show off vegan food.  \nYou may encounter some resistance if you choose a vegan place for a group of primarily omnivores, but consider how often you must make allowances for their 'dietary choices'. Obviously whether this is a good idea is down to your judgement of the situation based on your knowledge of the crowd.\n\n\n## Resources\n\n- [HappyCow](https://happycow.com) Is a wonderful website and app helping you to find vegan restaurants and vegan options near you\n",
