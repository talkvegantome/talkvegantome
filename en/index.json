Unlike [documentaries]({{\u003c ref \"/vegan-culture/documentaries\" \u003e}}) these movies present abstract ideas and thought experiments that *may* test your moral preconceptions. \n\nSimon Amstell's **Carnage** could have been included here, but, as it's more mockumentary in style you will find it on our list of [Films \u0026 Documentaries]({{\u003c ref \"/vegan-culture/documentaries\" \u003e}}).\n\n## The Wall (Die Wand) \n**By:** Julian Polser (Director) Marlen Haushofer (Book)   \n**Country or Origin:** Austria/Germany  \n**Genre:** Drama, Fantasy, Mystery  \n**Release Date:** 2012  \n**Critical reception:** Mesmerising, Philosophically rich drama… Stunningly original - *Johnathan Romney, London Film Festival*  \n**Issues covered:** [Human superiority]({{\u003c ref \"/anti-vegan/humans-are-superior\" \u003e}}), dominance vs stewardship, Ecofeminism (celebration of difference), animal community as family.  \n**Thoughts:** \"…explore[s] questions of cohabitation and encounter, human and non-human animality, as well as the threatening but liberating qualities associated with communicating disaster, sustainability, and responsibility for ‘end times’\" - *Wood Robertson (Scalar Aesthetic of Ecocinema).*  In Die Wand \"the last woman treats her fellow creatures in the forest with love and respects the 'great game of the sun, moon and stars'. After humanity's downfall, she reverses the traditional opposition of nature as chaos and civilisation as order. Nature and culture are still opponents, but the narrator perceives civilisation as chaotic and nature as pre-established harmony where every creature has the right to exist.\" *-  Sabine Frost (Literary and Filmic Imaginations of Nature, Humanity, and the Anthropocene in 'Die Wand' in Readings in the Anthropocene).*  \n**Links:** [IMDb](https://web.archive.org/web/20190619061331/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1745686/), [YouTube Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPtk3XDFY48), [Amazon DVD](https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wall-DVD-Martina-Gedeck/dp/B00DRGDKK6), [Prime Video](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wall-Martina-Gedeck/dp/B00KS5JCU6/ref=tmm_aiv_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8\u0026qid=\u0026sr=).\n\n## White God (Fehér isten)  \n**By:**  Kornél Mundruczó  \n**Country or Origin:** Hungary    \n**Genre:** Drama, Fantasy, Horror   \n**Release Date:** 2014  \n**Critical reception:**  A fierce and beautiful parable *- New York Times*.  Masterful *- Variety*. Remarkable and riveting haunting and quite extraordinary *- Deadline Hollywood*.  \n**WARNING:** This film can be extremely hard to watch! “As a parable for the indignities visited upon animals by their human superiors, the film states its intentions upfront: The first post-credits image is of a massive bovine carcass being unceremoniously stripped and gutted in an abattoir, entrails tumbling to the floor like damp laundry.”  *- Guy Lodge ([Chicargo Tribune](http://web.archive.org/web/20160126171831/https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-white-god-20150402-story.html))*. The later dog fight scenes are particularly harrowing and require repeating the mantra *‘no animals were harmed…’*  \n**Issues covered:** Speciesism, human cruelty, animal revolution.       \n**Thoughts:** This movie has “a profound thematic purpose: to show what animals endure at the hands of humans.” “White God is told mostly from the animals’ perspective. [allowing] viewers to see the [dogs] as equals.” Of note: not only were no dogs harmed in making this film “All of the untrained dogs who perform in this film were rescued from the streets or shelters and placed in homes with help from an adoption program.” *- Noah Gittell ([No Animals Were Harmed: The Unique Perspective of \"White God\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20180703075932/https://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/no-animals-were-harmed-the-unique-perspective-of-white-god))*.

Think KFC, McDonald’s and Burger King. It takes slaughterhouse videos and undercover investigations for us to see how our food is produced. Consumers, having no real knowledge of the cruelty they fund, continue to consume these products, without any guilt. Okja comments on this beautifully. The Superpig contest is nothing but a PR exercise intended on boosting sales and painting the people at Mirando as the good guys. The superpigs are marketed to be organic, non-GMO and better for the environment. Mirando even hires a celebrity zoologist and veterinarian Johnny Wilcox, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, to be the face of their brand. As the film progresses, we are taken behind the closed doors and made aware of the many facts that are being conveniently left out.

Primarily aimed at the philosophical question 'are we more than the sum of our memories'. However, Dark City is also a useful thought experiment on vivisection and human justification for vivisection. *Gregory Sadler* notes that the experimenters are “'antagonists' rather than 'villains'. There is a reason for this – despite appearances, they are not actually evil, merely misguided. They have what seem to them perfectly good reasons for what they do, and they seem genuinely frightened and disturbed when their plans are disrupted... *- ([Dark City, Descartes, and Narrative Doubts](http://web.archive.org/web/20151002092115/https://gbsadler.blogspot.com/2011/09/dark-city-descartes-and-narrative.html))*.

Maintaining the superiority of the human species at all costs is the only thing of any importance […]  [offers] a mirror into the mindset of the modern human. We want to keep our control of the comforts of life, our dominance of the planet, and our power over nature. We want to continue to enslave and kill other species for food we don’t need and persist with unrestrained industry at the expense of wildlife, nature, and a livable planet. These movies are a dire warning, a wakeup call to the human race that we are going down a very dark path and our arrogance will be our downfall. We have to live differently on this planet, or we may not be able to live here at all. We must take Ceaser’s offer of peace and stop enslaving animals, destroying nature, and hating each other.

          "description": "How to respond to the argument: If it's just you and a pig on a desert island surely you would eat the pig to survive?",
          "rawContent": "# Argument\n\n\u003e If it's just you and a pig on a desert island surely you would eat the pig to survive?\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Responses\n\n\u003e That’s a difficult question. If it's just you and a child on a desert island  would you eat the child to  survive? \n\nor\n\n\u003e That’s an interesting thought experiment. It is designed to test the Ethics of Emergencies and whether they differ in scope from everyday ethics. That the survivors of Flight 571 turned to cannabalism to survive in an emergency was not a mandate for cannabalism under everyday conditions. Similarly, even if a vegan did kill and eat the pig in an emergency this does not justify the unnecessary killing of animals under normal conditions.\n\n## Detail - Analytic\n\n### How does the argument go?\n\nThis thought experiment is usually presented as some sort of *“Gotcha”*. \n\n\u003e If it's just you and a pig on a desert island surely you would eat the pig so you could survive yourself? Then you wouldn't be vegan anymore would you?  \n\u003e Followed by: So if you (the vegan) choose to eat the pig, then that's no different from me eating pork when I choose.\n\nThis line of reasoning is both false (as discussed shortly) and shows a misunderstanding of the scope and nature of the thought experiment:\n\n## The thought experiment\n\nThe following is a more complete version of the thought experiment:\n\n\u003eA ship sinks and there are only two survivors. You and the other survivor have washed up on a small rocky island. You know when the next boat will pass and will be able to signal help. However, you will not survive till then unless you kill and eat your companion.  \n\nConsider that the other survivor is: a child, an adult; your pet dog; a pig.  Work through the thought experiment 4 times. Each time replace the other survivor with one of the options from the list. \n\n- Do you act the same way on each occasion? \n- Why/Why not?\n\n*(When rescued it will be assumed the other washed up dead. In the case where the other was a human you will never be charged with their murder)*\n\n### Don’t sidestep the issue!\n\nThe important thing about *thought experiments* is that you *think about them*. Don’t rush at justifying an answer; it’s more important to ponder the moral implications.\n\nSome of the sidesteps that should be avoided:\n\n- I’ll eat what the pig’s eating.  *No*, there is absolutely no other food source. \n- What if the other tried to eat you, so you had to kill them in self-defence?\n- While you wait for rescue, befriend the pig who would then provide company much like your pet cat or dog would? This might deflect the argument on to another interesting discussion but it still sidesteps this important thought experiment. You will *not* survive until rescued unless you kill the other survivor.\n- This couldn’t happen because… *(numerous reasons are presented)*. Yes, the thought experiment presents an improbable scenario but one that is logically possible. However, it really does not matter if the event could occur. Thought experiments are artificial constructs designed to test specific moral principles; you might argue that all thought experiments are invalid but it is far more interesting to engage and consider the implications.\n- You can’t kill the humans; that’s murder!  (Perhaps, but let’s not confuse legality with morality. *Is* the action morally justified? *…and remember you will never be charged with murder.*)\n\n### What’s the answer?\n\nThe temptation with thought experiments is to rush to an answer and then be forced to turn cartwheels in an attempt to justify that answer. Consider: \n\n- Would you kill the animal but not a child? Is that *just* because they are human? Are you making a claim of [human superiority]({{\u003c ref \"/anti-vegan/humans-are-superior\" \u003e}})? \n- Does killing/eating the pig in any way show a weakness in veganism? (*No*, it doesn’t, as we’ll demonstrate shortly). \n- Does killing and eating the child endorse cannabalism? \n- What moral principle are you applying?\n\n\u003e  The purpose of thought experiments is to make you think about the moral implications and principles.\n\nIt’s worth repeating one more time; the purpose here is *not* to force you to answer the questions. It’s to get you to engage with the concepts and consider the moral implications.\n\n\n### Suicide is painless?\n\n\n\u003e The difficulty, my friends, is not to avoid death, but to avoid unrighteousness - The Apology of Socrates *by* Plato.\n\nCo-Author Valerie has suggested that suicide, although extreme, could be an option to consider. As a vegan, it's a pretty hard decision to make to deliberately kill a pig, or any other animal, even in order to ensure my survival. While I could regard my own life as more important than the pig's, I recognise that the pig values their life as much as I value mine. So, the choice to take the life of another sentient being seems an impossible dilemma. The alternative thought is that of suicide; why kill the pig only to live the rest of my life depressed because my actions didn’t live up to my morals?\n\nThis echoes Socrates’ thoughts that death is preferable to sacrificing our deeply held morals.  This is possibly a noble ideal as, if you kill yourself and the other survivor is another human then you provide them with the means of survival. But, does the same logic apply when your companion is an animal? Yes, they can eat your remains and live a little longer but they won’t be rescued so will slowly die from dehydration and starvation. \n\nThis opens several new and interesting questions:\n\n- Even if you decide to commit suicide wouldn’t it be kinder to kill the animal first, rather than allowing it to suffer?\n- If you do mercy-kill the animal (to avoid any unnecessary suffering) does suicide remain your option? That is; is it wrong for a vegan to eat the flesh of the now dead animal to survive?\n\nOnce again, it is not necessary to answer these questions only to consider the moral implications of the thought experiment.\n\n### It is a Fallacy not an Argument\n\nWhile a fascinating thought experiment, when presented as an anti-vegan argument, it reveals a fallacy. The carnist’s argument runs something like:\n\n\u003e[Point 1] If it's just you and a pig on a desert island surely you would eat the pig so you could survive?  \n\u003e [Point 2] Then you wouldn't be vegan anymore would you?  \n\u003e [Point 3] So if you (the vegan) choose to eat the pig, that's no different from me eating pork when I choose.\n\nIn more analytical form; this implies that if you do a specific action under emergency conditions then that action is justified under any conditions. This is clearly false. As we noted earlier, the survivors of Flight 571 turned to cannabalism, eating the deceased to survive, but this was *not* a mandate for cannabalism under everyday conditions.\n\n\u003e It is important to differentiate between the rules of conduct in an emergency situation and the rules of conduct in the normal conditions of human existence. This does not mean a double standard of morality: the standard and the basic principles remain the same, but their application to either case requires precise definitions. - The Ethics of Emergencies *by* Ayn Rand\n\nLet’s recall the definition of veganism. A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude — *as far as is possible and practicable* - all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food…\n\nIn an emergency situation the unlikely, but possible, scenario where you *must* choose between your own life and the life of another could occur. If the companion was an animal would the vegan kill to survive? I have no idea and nor, I expect, does anyone unless they were actually in that situation. But, whichever action is chosen, it in no way negates the principles of veganism.\n\nIn our thought experiment it’s not possible to survive without killing the other, so the vegan might:\n\n- place their own life ahead of their companion’s, in this emergency, without feeling they had betrayed their vegan principles.\n-  consider the principles of veganism so important that a slow death from dehydration is a preferable option.\n\n### Final thoughts\n\nIt is unfortunate this fascinating thought experiment is misused as an anti-vegan argument. When it is, it becomes a fallacy and the important implications for moral principles are lost.\n\nThe Authors have no certainty about how they would act if marooned on an island with a pig; would their survival instincts or values prevail?  What we are certain about is that, regardless of what occurs on the island, it in no way justifies or condones the  unnecessary slaughter of millions of animals for nothing more than their taste.\n\n### Citations\n\n\u003e * The Apology *by* Plato *translated by* Benjamin Jowett *also available* [online](http://web.archive.org/web/20190805122204/http://www.sjsu.edu/people/james.lindahl/courses/Phil70A/s3/apology.pdf).\n\u003e * The Ethics of Emergencies *by* Ayn Rand *in* Normative Ethics: The Virtuos Egoist *also available* [online](https://web.archive.org/web/20191020181939/https://philosophyintrocourse.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/ayn-rand-the-ethics-of-emergencies.pdf).\n\n\n",

The alternative is accepting that 'even *if* it is the case we are uniquely superior, morality requires we care for those more vulnerable than ourselves; not that we treat them as a resource'.\n\nor\n\n\u003e Superiority requires *drawing a line* that seperates two groups and *falsely* identifies one group as deservedly superior to another. Yes, humans are unique and distinct from other animals in our capacity for complex problem solving. However, pick any species and you will likely find an attribute that also makes them unique and distinct. We should celebrate difference and not deny moral consideration to those who are different.\n \nor \n  \n\u003e No unique set of abilities or characteristics, in itself, provides a criterion for ‘superiority’.  For humans to claim that humans are superior because we have specific unique attributes is just another form of prejudice. \n\n\n## Detail - Analytic\n\n### Humans are different to other animals\n\nThat’s true. Humans have a capacity for complex problem solving that is not present in other animals. But why should a set of unique abilities or characteristics equate to superiority and give us the right to do what we like to those deemed inferior? Difference and uniqueness are not synonymous with superiority. \n\n\u003e Until recently it was considered that our capacity for abstract thought made us unique. However, “there is growing literature indicating that animals are capable of causal reasoning and abstraction”  \n\u003e [Decision-Making From the Animal Perspective: Bridging Ecology and Subjective Cognition (2019)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2019.00164/full)  \n\n \n ~\n\n\n\u003e A further \"finding suggests that fish might possess far higher cognitive powers than previously thought, [igniting] a high-stakes debate over how we assess the intelligence of animals that are so unlike ourselves.\"  \n\u003e [Fish Appear to Recognize Themselves in the Mirror (2019)](http://web.archive.org/web/20191004075152/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190207142234.htm)\n\n### On Superiority\n\n\n\u003e One definition of 'Superior' is, \"of higher rank, quality, or importance\" - [Merriam-Webster](http://web.archive.org/web/20190711165845/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/superior)\n\nWhat most people forget (*or choose to overlook*) in using the term superior is that; *We alone* determine the ranking systems. *We alone* determine what denotes better quality. *We alone* determine what makes one thing more important than another. To presuppose that 'we' are superior to 'them' and to then *choose* an attribute that separates 'us' from 'them' as (somehow) demonstrating superiority is a fallacy. Identifying difference never identifies superiority even when it grants power of one over another.  \n\n\u003e \"For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for precisely the same reasons.\"  \n\u003e - Douglas Adams *from* Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, 1979\n\n\n\n### The flawed reasoning of Superiority and Domination\n\n\u003e For any X and Y, if X is superior (or morally superior) to Y, then X is morally justified in subordinating Y.  \n\u003e - *The 'logic premise' from the 'Opressive Conceptual Framework' argument* as cited by Karen J. Warren\n \n or in plain English (and, as often used in anti-vegan rhetoric) \n \n \u003e if humans are superior to nonhuman animals, then humans are morally justified in treating nonhuman animals as a resource. \n \n\nThis logic is used to claim that humans are superior to, and may dominate, nonhumans *due to some difference* that is elevated (by humans) in importance. However, without the \"assumptions  that *humans are superior* to (at least some) nonhumans, and that *superiority justifies subordination*, all one has is some difference\" - Karen J. Warren *from* The Power and the Promise of Ecological Feminism *in* Environmental Ethics.\n\nThis creates what Warren refers to as an *oppressive conceptual framework*. An example is patriarchal thinking which falsely justifies the subordination of women by men based on nothing more than difference. Warren further claims that this logic of domination, and any conceptual framework which gives rise to it, \"must be abolished  in order to make possible a meaningful notion of difference...\"\n\nWe need to move away from the oppressive conceptual framework that maintains *sameness* and only extends the moral community to those who are similar to us by application of some self-determined criteria. Warren refers to this as *arrogant perception*, resulting in a false notion of superiority which gives rise to the claim that those like us deserve moral consideration and others don't.\n\nAn alternative *loving perception* \"presupposes and maintains difference - a distinction between the self and other, between human and at least some nonhumans - in such a way that perception of the other as other *is* an expression of love for one who/which is recognised at the outset as independent, dissimilar, different.\"  \n\nA *loving perception* requires that difference be cherished rather than used as a reason for domination. That nonhuman animals are different is a reason for celebration not a reason to treat them as a resource.\n\n\n\n### A Thought Experiment\n\nSuppose we discover an alien species (or more likely an intelligent species discovers us). That species has all of our abilities along with a technology far in advance of our own. They far exceed our mental capacity, can see a far greater colour spectrum and can hear sounds outside our aural range. They can also communicate telepathically.\n\nIf humans are superior to animals because of our unique capacity for complex problem solving then these aliens, with all our abilities plus the unique ability of telepathy, must be superior to us.\n\n- Does this mean the aliens are justified in harvesting the human species?\n\nIf you believe that we can use animals *as we choose* because we deem ourselves superior (due to unique attributes) then you must accept that the aliens would be justified in using us *as they choose* for the same reason.\n\nIf you believe the aliens would act wrongly in harvesting the human species then you need to reconsider your claim that human superiority gives us the right to use animals *as we choose*.\n\n### Superiority - so what?\n\n\u003e ...to care for and about others is what being vegan is all about.\n\nEven assuming that humans' unique abilities do *as a matter of fact* demonstrate superiority it’s unclear why or how this is relevant. One of the cornerstones of morality is that we care for those less capable (or more vulnerable) than ourselves, and caring for others is what being vegan is all about.\n\n### Citations\n\n* Decision-Making From the Animal Perspective: Bridging Ecology and Subjective Cognition *by* Sergey Budaev, Christian Jørgensen, Marc Mangel, Sigrunn Eliassen and Jarl Giske in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, 2019.  \n* The Power and the Promise of Ecological Feminism *by* Karen J.

          "rawContent": "\n# Argument\n\n\u003e Veganism is often criticised for failing to adequately address specific environmental concerns; such as pest control.\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e Environmental Ethics is complex and difficult. Even assuming we can reach agreement on the definition of pest it does not automatically follow that humans *ought* to control or eradicate any species.\n\nor\n\n\u003e While the ideals of veganism are always placed first, individual vegans will differ on what, if any, actions ought to be taken. This can range from 'do nothing' (*all species have a right to life*) to 'controlling possums' (applying the golden rule of *acting to bring about the least harm*)\n\n  \n## Detail - Analytic\n\nIt is difficult to interpret how the central principle of veganism *‘avoid exploitation of and cruelty to animals'* might be applied in complex environmental considerations. \n\nHowever, before we try, a few concepts require unpacking.\n\n### 1. Veganism is a moral standpoint. \n\n\nVeganism is not a moral theory.  Veganism is a moral standpoint regarding the (mis)treatment of animals by (most) humans, either directly or by passive acceptance. We can’t expect specific moral standpoints to offer complete answers to questions that are fully or partially outside their scope.  That said, there is considerable crossover between environmental and animal concerns so intuitively we expect that vegans ought to hold a position on environmental issues\n\n### 2. What is a pest?\n\nPest is commonly defined along the lines of any “small animal which damages crops or food supplies” ([Collins](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009200032/https://www.dictionary.com/browse/pest)) or “any animal or plant detrimental to human concerns” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(organism))).  \n\n\u003e Speciesism is a form of discrimination based on species membership. It involves treating members of one species as morally more important than members of other species even when their interests are equivalent.  \n\u003e  - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism)\n\nVegans will NOT accept this definition of pest as it is 'speciesist’. That an animal’s interests conflict with human interests is not, in itself, a reason for defining the animal as a pest or for taking action against them. Where crops are concerned alternative means such as fencing, sonics, and eco-friendly organic practices are available.  \n\n## Re-defining ‘pest’.\n\n\u003e \"A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.”  \n\u003e - Aldo Leopold (1949) [The Land Ethic](http://web.archive.org/web/20191009200336/https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil3140/Leopold.pdf) \n\nAldo Leopold, the father of environmental ethics, provides a non-speciesist means to identify problematic species in \"The Land Ethic\". A species is problematic (a 'pest') when, regardless of human interest, it upsets the stability of, interrupts the integrity of, or leads to the destruction of the environment.  \n\nTwo New Zealand specific examples:\n\n### Are wild rabbits a pest?\n\n[Biosecurity NZ](http://web.archive.org/web/20191007214252/https://www.mpi.govt.nz/protection-and-response/long-term-pest-management/wild-rabbits/) lists rabbits as pests because they ‘compete with livestock, cause extensive damage to farming land, cause public nuisance...'\n\nSo, yes, they are annoying to (some) humans but they are not a ‘pest’. The reasons provided by Biosecurity NZ fail under Leopold’s criteria. If wild rabbits are a pest other more substantial, non-speciesist, reasons must be provided.\n\n### Are possums a pest?\n\nPossums occur in high numbers in NZ, breed fast and face very few predators. Without doubt possums have a major impact on New Zealands native ecosystems.\n\n[Department of Conservation NZ](https://web.archive.org/web/20190227050251/https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/pests-and-threats/animal-pests/possums/) lists possums as pests, as, “Leaves are the main part of their diet, but possums are opportunistic omnivores. They eat buds, flowers, fruit/berries and nectar, which means they compete with native birds and reptiles for food sources. The growth and life-cycle of a tree or plant is significantly affected when all parts of it are eaten. Possums also have ‘favourites’ such as rātā or kamahi trees, leading to an even greater impact on these species.  … Possums were [also] filmed eating the eggs and chicks of kōkako …  They eat invertebrates, including weta, and are significant predators of New Zealand land snails such as Powelliphanta. They often occupy holes in tree trunks for their nests which would otherwise be used by nesting birds such as kākāriki and saddlebacks. …Researchers using nest-cameras have witnessed … kea nests invaded by stoats and possums in South Westland. ”\n\nHere it would seem possums can be defined as a ‘pest species’ that directly impacts the ecosystem, without any reference to human specific interests.\n\n### To recap\n\nVegans may still object to the term 'pest'. A species that is out-of-place in the eco-system is, in most cases, due to past meddling by humans and not a fault of the species. \n\nVegans can classify a species as problematic by reference to Leopold's non-speciesist definition. However, once identified, any action taken must *as far as is possible and practicable* be neither exploitive nor unnecessarily cruel.\n\n### Final thoughts \n\n\u003e Identifying a species as problematic does not commit a vegan to act in any specific manner. However, that vegans can offer a non-speciesist definition of 'pest' and can argue for a specific approach in dealing with them demonstrates that vegans can address complex environmental concerns.\n\nWhile the ideals of veganism are always placed first, individual vegans will differ on what, if any, actions ought to be taken. This can range from 'do nothing' (*all species have a right to life*) to 'controlling possums' (applying the golden rule of *acting to bring about the least harm*).\n\n*This is discussed in more depth in the appendix.*\n\nThis disagreement over 'how to act' is no different from individuals facing any difficult complex moral questions. Conflicts of opinion arise over euthanasia, abortion, freedom of speech, and many others.\n\n\n## Appendix.\n\n### Fitting all this into Moral Philosophy\n\nThe next section discusses ethical theory in some depth.  Dive in if you're interested, but it's the sort of stuff that causes some people to gnaw their own limbs off. (*I'm just kidding, honestly... it's safer than Vogon poetry.*)\n\nPerhaps, take a break and come back to it later. But If you do decide to skip this section the arguments above should be enough to serve you in your day-to-day discussions.\n\n\n### Back to the recap.\n\n1. Within a vegan ethic it is reasonable to classify a species as a pest by reference to a non-speciesist definition.  \n2. Even when a species is classified as a pest the principles of veganism require that they NOT be exploited or treated cruelly  \n3. Veganism is a moral standpoint so we should not expect it to prescribe a course of action. Rather, veganism limits how we might act (and certainly the manner in which we act).\n\n### So where to from here? \n\nWhile the ideals of veganism are always placed first, an individual vegan may embody any number of specific moral theories including, (but not limited to) rights based, utilitarianism, eco-feminism, egoism or virtue theory. A vegan may even take an eclectic approach and combine two or more of these moral theories. \n\nThis is no different to the environmentalist (or indeed any member of the human species) who all hold differing views about the nature of the good, and of right and wrong acts.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity we’ll look at just two positions; the rights-based vegan and the utilitarian vegan.\n\n### Rights-based vegan\n\n\u003e \"..all those individuals who are subjects-of-a-life ... have inherent value and thus enjoy an equal moral status.\"  \n\u003e - Tom Regan [The Case for Animal Rights](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009200412/https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/on-the-human/2011/05/regan-preface/)\n\n  \n\u003e \"...animals have one right--the right not to be treated as property.\"  \n\u003e - Gary Francione [Animals--Property or Persons?](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009200445/https://law.bepress.com/rutgersnewarklwps/art21/)\n\nThe ‘rights-based’ vegan may hold a position along the egalitarian lines of Tom Regan or the abolitionist position of Gary Francione. Those holding these or similar views might argue that we should not cull a pest species as we simply cannot, and should not, choose to eradicate one species to protect another. Other actions to protect the endangered species may be permissable but violating the possum’s *equal* right to life is not an option.\n\n### Utilitarian-based vegan\n\n\u003e \"If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering - in so far as rough comparisons can be made - of any other being.\"   \n\u003e - Peter Singer (1979) [Equality for Animals?](https://web.archive.org/web/20191009200532/https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1979----.htm)\n\nThe utilitarian vegan may adopt a position similar to Peter Singer *(considered by many the father of the modern animal rights movement)* and argue that the preferences *(interests)* of all affected must be considered equally.\n\nFor utilitarians consequences matter most and to *decide to do nothing* is to burden the responsibility for what follows. The consequence of doing  nothing in the possum scenario is the death (and possible extinction) of many other creatures; a consequence which for utilitarian-vegans seems intuitively wrong.\n\nUtilitarian-vegans might argue that where the eco-system is at risk, maximising preferences (and working towards a consequence that results in the least harm) requires controlling a pest species. \n\nThe ideal would be some form of biological contraception but, unfortunately, this is some years off. So, it would seem that for the utilitarian-vegan it is neither exploitive nor unnecessarily cruel to control (by culling) the possum population in the humanest way possible.\n\n*Please note that an extremely simplified version of rights based and utilitarian based ethics has been presented here.

Fine they are killed at the end of their lives, but they still get to live!\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e A world without animals being exploited by humans sounds like a wonderful world. Wild animals would continue to exist, we could even re-introduce breeds of wild sheep, cows, and pigs to the [vast areas of land]({{\u003c ref \"facts/land-usage\"\u003e}}) currently used for farming.  All the livestock that are alive today will be killed [within 18 months]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animal-life-expectancy\"\u003e}}) (barring dairy cows whose constant pregnancy goes on for up to 4 years). It is a cycle of oppression without end. Stop the next generation of animals being slaughtered, go vegan.\n\n## Detail\n\nThis argument is predicated on the idea that it's better to have a life than not, which seems intuitively compelling at first, if _wildly_ debatable considering some of the horrors of animal agriculture. But let's put that argument aside for a moment, because it has a hidden conclusion that:\n\n\u003e Because I'm giving a life to these animals in the first place, we can overlook the fact that I kill them for profit in [as little as 1.6% of their natural lifespan]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animal-life-expectancy\"\u003e}}).\n\nLet's take the lifespan of the animal destined to live the longest percentage of the natural lifespan, the dairy cow. They are [typically slaughtered at 4 years old]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animal-life-expectancy\"\u003e}}), which is 16-20% of their 15-20 natural year lifespan. In human terms (assuming an average lifespan of 80, which is generous), that would mean they would have been slaughtered at the age of 13-15. \n\nIt's hard to think of applying the same argument to some-one farming humans to the age of 13-15 years old. \"Oh but they have a good life while they're alive!\" rings false when life ends so abruptly and so early.\n\nForests could recover land from which they were lost, animals would actually flourish if the land dedicated to animal agriculture was left fallow. It's a more verdant, more diverse world that we would stand to see if animal agriculture came to an end.",

I don't want to be that awkward person at a party asking if everything is vegan! \n\nor \n\n\u003e I'm not going to ask my mum what's in her cooking and refuse to eat it if it's not vegan, she will crucify me!\n\n# Rebuttal  \n\n\u003e Awkwardness is part and parcel of standing up for what you believe in. If you're not willing to stand up for veganism, what other moral convictions will you cast aside when it becomes too awkward to express them? In order for our actions and morality to matter we've got to voice it when it's important. Otherwise you are just following whatever is socially acceptable rather than thinking critically about your opinions.\n\n## Detail\n\nThis was a big part of the reason that I was vegetarian for a year prior to going vegan. I felt there was a lot of stigma with the word vegan and didn't want to be associated with it. I didn't want to be mocked, and I didn't want to have to explain myself under the attention of numerous people. I was embarrassed. Eventually I realised a number of things:  \n\n1. Opting out of what I believed as a moral conviction because I was scared to associate with it was not the best version of myself. It was a betrayal of my core values.\n2. You get to choose how to act as a vegan. You can be as quiet or as loud as you like, you can be as compassionate or outraged at carnists as you like. Be the vegan you wish you had met. No-one can take your v-card away.\n3. The impression you have of veganism almost certainly comes from the most vocal/controversial portions of the community. If you don't identify with that, that's fine, there's the vast majority of the vegan community you haven't heard from.\n4. The outrage you see from the most controversial activists is very justified. If [70 billion]({{\u003c ref \"facts/animals-killed-annually\"\u003e}}) humans were being killed needlessly every year we would judge people who _weren't_ outraged.\n5. You don't have to approve of all actions of all other vegans. There is tonnes of internal debate and saying \"I don't agree with that\" is absolutely fine so long as you still don't use animal products!\n6. You being the vegan you want to see in the world is a chance to change people's mind about veganism, it is an act of activism in itself to share your form of compassion and discussion with other people, even on a very low-key level.\n\n# Advice \n\n## Family\nFamily in particular can be _really_ hard to tackle with veganism, in part because many families use food as an expression of love. If not handled carefully, even a highly-non-confrontational passing on a plate of food can come across as rejection of it as 'not good enough', which can make the parent in turn feel inadequate or rejected personally.  \n\nWhat you put in your body is **your choice**, however. You should never feel obliged to consume anything you don't feel comfortable with just to please some-one else. When approached with honesty and compassion, and crucially clarity that it is not a rejection of their cooking, of their love, or of them, an understanding can usually be found. A great way of dealing with it is offering to cook for your family in order to A) show them that vegan food is not just lettuce and grated carrots and B) that you are willing to put in the effort to show some goodwill.\n\n## Friends \u0026 Colleagues\nSocial situations can be tough in general, especially when you don't know the crowd's disposition towards veganism. Remember to take into account your own level of comfort with attention, and desire to talk about veganism when choosing your approach. It can be a great opportunity to talk about veganism with a new crowd, but you're no less vegan if you aren't comfortable with the spotlight on you and choose to fly under the radar as much as possible.\n\n",

Imagine how much higher that is when there is no oversight.\n\nIn all types of consumption in a 21st century society there is almost guaranteed to be some form of cruelty, and this must stop in all its forms. The difference with animal agriculture, however, is that stopping the cruelty without stopping the practice itself is impossible because the subject of the cruelty _is the product_. It's possible to imagine a world, campaign for a world, vote for a world, spend towards a world where the production of consumer goods and food does not involve the suffering of human beings (and we should!). But it is not possible to have a world where animal agriculture does not have suffering when animals are the product. Any business will try to maximise profits and minimise costs, often at the expense of the humans working for them, and this inherent opposition between profit and welfare will always see welfare lose out because animals cannot advocate for themselves. It is nearly impossible for a minimum wage worker who needs the income to blow the whistle on unsafe or inhumane working conditions without putting their family's livelihood in jeopardy. Animals are similarly silenced, unable to speak for themselves and tell a story even to those who will listen.\n",

          "rawContent": "\n# Argument \n\n\u003e It's okay to kill animals because they aren't sentient/sapient\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e Animals can sense the world around them just like we can, feel pain just like we can, and they _most definitely_ can suffer, just like we can. Just because animals are not self-aware (sapient) does not give us the right to cause them suffering and death. \n\nThe famous quote from Jeremy Bentham is appropriate here: \n\n\u003e What else is it that should trace the insuperable line [between those afforded protection by the law and those that are not]? Is it the faculty of reason, or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day, or a week, or even a month, old But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? [T]he question is not, Can they reason? nor Can they talk? but Can they suffer?  \n\u003e  - Jeremy Bentham – An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation - 1789 - p311\n\n## Detail - Analytic \n\n### Sapience vs Sentience\n\nFirst let's clear up some common confusion around the world 'sentience'. \n\n\u003e A sentient being is capable of experiencing things through its senses.  \n\u003e - [Collins English Dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sentient)\n\nSo animals are clearly sentient because they have ears and eyes and noses through which to sense the world.\n\n\u003e [Sentience vs Sapience] is the distinction between being aware in the sense of being merely\nawake (which we share with nondiscursive animals - those that do not grasp concepts), on the one hand, and, on the other hand, being aware in a sense that involves knowledge either by being a kind of knowledge, or as potentially serving to justify judgments that so qualify.  \n\u003e - Robert Brandom's Study Guide to Wilfrid Sellars' Empricism and the Philosophy of Mind - Harvard University Press - 1997 - p121-122\n\nSapience is what most people are thinking of when they mean sentience. The ability to know things and reason with that knowledge.\n\n\n### Sapience Matters - Suffering is worse with sapience\n\n\u003e It's okay to eat animals because they are not sapient. The suffering of animals is less because they cannot anticipate their death, or understand that they are going to be slaughtered.  \n\nEven if this were true (it's not, animals at slaughterhouses know full well what's going to happen to them!) the idea that a hypothetical human's existential dread while being 'raised' for slaughter would be that much greater suffering than an animal's experience does not diminish the animal's suffering in any way. It is wrong to cause suffering, it is wrong to take someone's life away even if they are unable to anticipate it. \n\n# Sources\n\n- Robert Brandom's Study Guide to Wilfrid Sellars' Empricism and the Philosophy of Mind - Harvard University Press - 1997 \n- [Jeremy Bentham – An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation - 1789](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xqkSAQAAMAAJ\u0026dq=An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Principles%20of%20Morals%20and%20Legislation\u0026pg=PA311#v=onepage\u0026q\u0026f=false)",

          "rawContent": "\n# Argument\n\n\u003e You not consuming animal products isn't even a blip in the market, the same number of animals will be raised and killed whether you buy animal products or not.\n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Response\n\n\u003e Just because we cannot stop animal cruelty does not mean we should be part of it.  \n\u003e It is our responsibility as consumers to vote with our wallet for the things we support.\n\n## Detail - Analytic - Our Actions are our Ethics\n\nIn a capitalist framework, one of the only ways to influence companies is through 'voting with your dollar'. This has already lead to the blossoming of vegan options in supermarkets around the world with companies rushing to take advantage of increasing vegan market.  \nEven if supply and demand didn't have an impact on companies production choices (e.g. milk subsidies in the US) we implicitly take a position on the morality of these industries by deciding whether or not we participate in them. Just because we cannot stop animal cruelty does not mean we should be part of it.\n\nThis fatalistic argument suggests that because an injustice is the status quo and there is no reasonable hope of ending it that we are morally justified in participating in it.  \n\n### Thought Experiment - Yulin Dog Festival\nLet's look at that through the lens of a different example, not even a terribly different one. Eating dogs.  \nAs a tourist to China you visit Yulin during the summer solstice, and visit the [Yulin Dog Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychee_and_Dog_Meat_Festival) where freshly cooked dog flesh is as available on the streets as pig and sheep flesh is all year round the world over.  \nUnder normal circumstances you (presumably) find the idea of killing and eating dogs morally abhorrent, do you suspend this value judgement and eat the dog meat in Yulin? If not, why not? No more or fewer dogs will be killed based on your decision.  \n\nIf the answer is \"because it's still wrong\" then you need to face that this is true of other animals as well, irrespective of whether or not you abstain from consuming them would result in a direct reduction of suffering.  \n\nIf the answer is \"Because I find it personally uncomfortable but I would be okay with it otherwise\" then we're getting down to the core of the issue. Why are you okay with eating dog abstractly if you believe killing dogs for food is wrong? \"There's no negative consequence to eating the dog once it's already dead. Why not eat it if you want to?\"\n\nIn the Yulin dog festival scenario there are two things wrong with this:\n\n1. You will be supporting the industry by paying for the meal, that money goes back into next year's festival to breed more dogs for slaughter.\n2. There is a disconnect here between the ethics of your actions and the ethics of the consequences of your actions.\n\n### Thought Experiment - Dead Body at the Side of the Road\nLet's look at the aforementioned ethical disconnect between actions and consequences through the light of another thought experiment.  \n\nSuppose you find a body on the side of the road, killed by a hit and run. Rather morbidly you rifle through the journal you find in their pocket learning they are entirely alone in this world and unmissed by anyone. You are miles away from any jurisdiction, on a disused logging road deep in the forest, the police will never find the body.  \nIs it ethical to eat the body?  \n\nMost people will be repulsed by the question and say of course it isn't ethical, how could it be? Eating people is inherently wrong, unlike animals.  \nBut what is the difference between this scenario and the Yulin dog scenario? If anything this scenario is _more_ clear from negative consequences because you're not providing monetary support to the person who did the killing, and therefore are not contributing to the likelihood that more people will be killed. \n\nThe difference is that you've successfully internalised that eating people is wrong irrespective of the circumstances, and are therefore unwilling to eat people _even_ if it doesn't make a difference to how likely it is for more people to die.  \n\nIt is this internalisation of rightness or wrongness that most vegans hinge on when they make the decision not to consume animal products. It's not _even about_ whether or not an individual can make a difference (hint they can, influentially, in aggregate, and over time), it's about whether the action is fundamentally right or wrong.\n\nIt is, at its core, about the fact that an animal had to die in order for you to be able to eat them.\n\n## Detail - Analytic - Monetary Support\n\nThe second problem with saying \"it's okay to eat a dog in the Yulin dog festival\" when you disagree with the concept of killing dogs for food, is that irrespective of whether your purchasing the dog meat makes the dog any less dead, that purchasing decision _is_ the demand that business owners take into account when they make stock decisions. \n\nYour money from purchasing the dog meat will go towards breeding more dogs for next year's festival, and even if the amount you pay is paltry, it has to be considered in aggregate. If every tourist supports the dog meat industry, it will grow to accommodate that demand. If none of them do, it will shrink accordingly. \n\n## Detail - Motive - Impact of Individual's Actions - All Actions are Activism in an Oppressive System\n\nAll political movements engaged with righting a wrong throughout history have been composed of individuals. Without individuals there is no movement, and every action you take in service of animal liberation is an act of resistance against the status quo. The waiter whom you ask for the vegan option, might just think 'huh, so many people are ordering that these days, I should check it out'. Your conversation with your friend might plant the seed of receptivity to veganism, and they might inspire others in turn to go vegan. The animal rights march you take part in might be the biggest ever and make the news. You might inspire, or get inspired through activism to be, a driving force in the animal rights movement.  \n\nEvery action, no matter how small, matters. You don't have to boil the ocean, you just have to make a splash.\n\nWhatever you do, just don't forget, veganism is not for vegans.  \n\n**Veganism is for the animals.**",

          "rawContent": "\n# Argument\n\n\u003e It's impossible to have completely vegan food. Fertilizers are derived from animal waste and bones, pesticides are used on crops to kill insects, bees are kept in portable hives to pollinate almonds, worms are killed by tilling fields. All food involves death.\n\nThis can be unpacked as three different arguments:\n\n1. You eat foods that are not completely vegan therefore your claim that animal exploitation is morally wrong is false.\n\n2. You accept the deaths of some animals to produce your foods of preference. This is morally indistinguishable from the deaths that occur to produce my foods of preference.\n\n3. Veganism is logically impossible - it is impossible to produce food without exploiting animals. \n\n# Rebuttal\n\n## Quick Responses\n\n#### (Argument #1) \n\u003e This argument is an appeal to hypocrisy (*the Tu quoque fallacy*). That I fail to meet my own standards is nothing more than a personal failure and does not invalidate my principles. My failure to pick up a piece of litter that I've dropped does not invalidate my claim that littering is wrong. That I may fall short and in some way be complicit in an animal's death in no way invalidates the moral claim that the exploitation of animals is wrong.\n\u003e\n\n#### (Argument #2)\n\u003e  \"It is wrong to inflict unnecessary death on nonhuman animals and it is especially wrong ... to do so intentionally. Where one must choose between bringing about death as a side-effect, one should, all else equal, pursue the latter course of action\".  \n\u003e - The Intentional Killing of Field Animals and Ethical Veganism *by*  Joe Wills\n\n#### (Argument #3) \n\u003e \"While not logically impossible, it is *almost impossible* to avoid being complicit in suffering with our current food chain. Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, *as far as is possible and practicable*, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals [...]. Raising an animal from forcible impregnation to their untimely death merely to satisfy our desire for taste is not comparable to deaths we have little way of avoiding as consumers.\"  \n\u003e - Definition of veganism verbatim from [The Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism)\n\n## Detail - Analytic\n\n### Argument #1 *Moral Consistency*\n\nTrying to trip vegans up by exposing real or imagined inconsistencies is common rhetoric. The reality is that vegans (being human) are typically not perfect. Vegans are subject to the constraints of time, money, knowledge, availability of resources, and a million other factors. \n\nThat a vegan may fail in no way invalidates the moral claim that the exploitation of animals is wrong.\n\n\u003e Argument #1 is a fallacy (the appeal to hypocrisy).\n\n### Argument #2 *Intent \u0026 Knowledge*\n\nVegans must eat and, where there are limited options, follow the path of least harm.\n\n\n\u003eA golden rule of moral philosophy is, \"all things being equal you ought to choose the action that does the least harm”.\n\nWhile it is true that some animals do die in the production and harvesting of crops vegans do not ‘accept these deaths’ without question.  Where a crop farmer fails to *exercise due diligence to minimize the harm* and deaths occur, an obligation falls on vegans *as far as is possible and practicable* to seek alternatives (e.g. moving towards organic vegetables, buying from [vegan farms](https://www.viva.org.uk/what-we-do/vegan-farming), avoiding mono-cultures etc.)\n\n\u003e ### Doctrine of Double Effect\n\u003e - the nature of the act is itself good, or at least morally neutral;  \n\u003e - the individual intends the good effect and does not intend the bad effect, either as a means to the good or as an end in itself;  \n\u003e - the good effect outweighs the bad effect in circumstances sufficiently grave to justify causing the bad effect, and the individual exercises due diligence to minimize the harm.  \n\u003e \n\u003e *from* Double-Effect Reasoning: Doing Good and Avoiding Evil *by* T. A. Cavanaugh.\n \nIn other words a cattle farmer *intends* to kill the cattle, the crop farmer's intention is primarily to grow crops. Any deaths that may occur during crop harvest are a side-effect of a morally neutral act. \n\n- A counter might follow that 'regardless of intention or acceptance the animals die, so I might as well get my meat.'\n\nThis counter argument fails to take into account an individual's knowledge of what will occur.\n\n* A cattle farmer knows that the cattle will be slaughtered and intends for them to be slaughtered.\n\n* A crop farmer knows that some animals (e.g rabbits, birds, rodents) may be killed during harvest but the intention is only to harvest crops. (The crop farmer would far prefer the animals were not in the field).\n \nConsider the following thought experiment:\n\n\u003e You are controlling a tram. As long as you hold a lever the tram will continue on its current track.  However, you know there are people on the track ahead who will be killed if the tram continues.  \n\u003e If you release the lever the tram will change tracks. You suspect there are people on the other track as well.\n\n1. Continuing to hold the lever is to kill with both certainty and intent.\n\n2. Releasing the lever is to know that some people *might* be killed.\n\nKnowingly risking some deaths is morally preferable to killing with certainty and intent.\n\nHumans hold a lever which results in the intentional deaths of millions of animals. It's time to let go of the lever; the knowledge that some animals will probably die as a result of crop farming is not an argument against veganism.\n\n\u003e Vegans do not accept the deaths of some animals to produce our foods of preference. While vegans know this may occur it is not the intent and, wherever possible, steps are taken to reduce and mitigate this harm. \n\u003e \n\u003e  There is considerable moral difference between slaughtering animals with intent and deaths that occur as an unintentional side effect of crop farming, even where we know the deaths might occur. \n\n\n### Argument #3 *Definition of Veganism*\n\nThe definition of veganism is in our Quick Response but it's so important it's worth repeating: \n\n\u003e Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.  \n\u003e - [The Vegan Society - Definition of Veganism](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism)\n\nThe claim that ‘veganism is logically impossible' misrepresents the nature of veganism. As with any moral standpoint perfection is not expected. Rather, vegans strive toward the ideal of a world without exploitation and cruelty. However, it is necessary to recognise that it is nearly impossible to exist without cruelty to animals or people while still participating in a 21st century society, and to forgive ourselves for the things we cannot avoid. \n\nTo exist, as far as is possible and practicable*, without exploitation of, or cruelty to, animals is both logical and possible.\n\n#### * What does *possible and practicable* mean?\n\nThis is not an excuse to have a steak when there isn't a vegan option at the restaurant. Eating a boring salad is a very minor discomfort by comparison with the horrors that animals face in slaughterhouses. \n\nNor is it an excuse to not learn those pesky [E-numbers]({{\u003c ref \"/shopping/e-numbers\" \u003e}}). The mistreatment of animals does not compare to committing these to memory, or carrying around the TalkVeganToMe App.\n\n\n\n\u003e *Possible and practicable* is NOT a line vegans draw for themselves to mitigate some perceived inconvenience. it is a reference to the threshold a ‘rational person’ would set; ‘all other things being equal’. \n\nThis appeal to a rational person is not an excuse to gatekeep veganism by arguing against other peoples' decisions. Remember you do not have all the facts when someone relays a story about a time they had to make a difficult decision.\n\nMoral decisions are not arbitrary, but neither is it your role to act as jury for other people's decisions. The 'rational person' clause simply provides a medium for academic discussions regarding veganism.\n\nNo-one can take your v-card away, and you cannot take anyone else's away either.\n",

The actual fact is that veganism stems from a _very real_ understanding of what it means to eat meat. Vegan documentaries are full of footage from slaughterhouses and factory farms, places that people who eat meat typically never see let alone visit. \n\nIt is hard to imagine anything more 'disconnected from the harsh realities of the world' than taking a plastic package of meat and consuming it without ever having even _thought_ of the animal which it came from.\n\n\n",

Furthermore, although the phytoestrogen content in animal products is low when compared to soy-based foods (e.g., soy milk), the range is similar to that of many commonly consumed vegetables.  \n\u003e -  [Phytoestrogen Content of Foods of Animal Origin: Dairy Products, Eggs, Meat, Fish, and Seafood - Journal of Agricultural Food Chemistry - 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20191020110539/https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jf801344x)\n\n### What isoflavones does soy contain?\n\u003e Soy contains the isoflavones:  \n\u003e - Biochanin A   \n\u003e - Clycitein   \n\u003e - Daidzein  \n\u003e - Formononetin  \n\u003e - Genistein    \n\u003e - [The pros and cons of phytoestrogens - Front Neuroendocrinol - 2010 - p2](https://web.archive.org/web/20190928181945/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3074428/pdf/nihms271669.pdf)\n\n## How do isoflavones interact with the body?\n\u003e Some isoflavones, most notably genistein, inhibit pathways important for cell growth and proliferation, an effect which affects multiple organ systems.  \n\u003e - [The pros and cons of phytoestrogens - Front Neuroendocrinol - 2010 - p4](https://web.archive.org/web/20190928181945/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3074428/pdf/nihms271669.pdf)\n\nIn other words, it's possible for human cell growth to be increased by phytoestrogens.\n\n\u003e Phytoestrogens are plant‐derived [small amounts can also be found in animal products, see above] dietary compounds with structural similarity to 17‐β‐oestradiol (E2), the primary female sex hormone. This structural similarity to E2 enables phytoestrogens to cause (anti)oestrogenic effects by binding to the oestrogen receptors.  \n\u003e [...]  \n\u003e [P]hytoestrogens are also considered endocrine disruptors, indicating that they have the potential to cause adverse health effects such as infertility and increased risks of cancer in oestrogen-sensitive organs.  \n\u003e - [The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens - British Journal of Pharmacology](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922065924/https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.13622)  \n\nPhytoestrogens have a similar shape to human estorogen, which enables them to interrupt the normal absorption of human estrogen in the endocrine (hormonal) system.\n\n\u003e Phytoestrogens produce estrogenic, anti-estrogenic or no activity depending upon the tissue. [Oestrogen Receptor Alpha] and [Oestrogen Receptor Beta] display distinct expression patterns in male and female[s...].  \n\u003e - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p7](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)\n\nPhytoestrogens effects vary from one body part to another and from one sex expression to another.\n\nFrom these sources we can conclude that soy's phytoestrogens can have an effect on the human body, *what* exactly that effect may be is covered in more detail in [Soy is bad for you?]({{\u003cref \"/facts/soy-is-bad-for-you\"\u003e}}).\n\nIt's also worth noting that a huge variety of foods contain phytoestrogens, including oats, beans, rice, coffee, apples, yams, [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoestrogen) and even [animal products](https://web.archive.org/web/20191020110539/https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jf801344x). \n\n\n# Sources\n\n - [British Dietetic Association - Soya and health - the basics - 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20190928091728/https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/soya2017.pdf)\n- [Front Neuroendocrinol - The pros and cons of phytoestrogens - 2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20190928181945/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3074428/pdf/nihms271669.pdf)\n- [British Journal of Pharmacology - The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens - 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922065924/https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.13622)  \n- [Phytoestrogen Content of Foods of Animal Origin: Dairy Products, Eggs, Meat, Fish, and Seafood - Journal of Agricultural Food Chemistry - 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20191020110539/https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jf801344x)",

          "rawContent": "\n# Popular Fact\n\n\u003e Soy's phytoestrogens cause a variety of negative health effects due to interfering with hormones.\n\nSee our article: [Soy contains estrogen]({{\u003cref \"/facts/soy-contains-estrogen\"\u003e}}) for more information on phytoestrogens.\n\n# Reality\nTalkVeganToMe's layman's understanding from surveying the material available online is that: \n\n1. Soy contains phytoestrogens which are structurally similar to human estrogen (specifically *isoflavones*) which can have hormonal effects on the body.\n2. The maximum safe dosages are not well understood. \n3. It is _unlikely_ that you will ingest a high enough dosage to affect your health as part of a balanced diet provided you do not have any special circumstances (e.g. hypothyroidism, infancy, etc.). But you should ensure that you vary your protein sources and consult your dietitian for special circumstances (e.g. hypothyroidism, infancy, etc.) see *Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - 2018* below.  \n4. All articles on the topic caveat their conclusions with: 'more research is needed'.  \n  \n\nThis is a highly complex and fast moving topic in terms of research. We've discounted a number of the most popular pro-soy sources (see *Conflicts of Interest* below). We've also intentionally put the position of the Vegan Society to one side until we understand the original sources properly (see *Vegan Society* below).\n\nWhat remains is the truest representation of the research we've surveyed from our layman's ability to digest them. Despite assessing nearly [80 articles and meta-analyses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTayf4Bn7PT7xHNrQ_ehIQV_8gTWRLN9of5Kfm_GuPf9CAPtJ5hZfxEAvTvZub_orWOuPrCxIr7RpTq/pubhtml) we have relied particularly heavily on [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/) as it is a highly relevant, highly recent, and seemingly unbiased meta-analysis of the research.\n\nYou may come to a different conclusion based on the evidence provided, which is why we have cited, quoted, and linked to our sources so you can make an informed decision. If you wish to reach us regarding anything we've said in this article, please contact [support@talkveganto.me](mailto:support@talkveganto.me)\n\n\n## 1. Phytoestrogens can have hormonal (and anti-hormonal) effects.\n\nThis was our biggest surprise in researching this topic, as we had heard over and over again that soy contained _plant_ estrogen, you don't need to worry about plant estrogen as they can't interact with the human body hormonally!\n\nUnfortunately phytoestrogens are not so easily dismissed. See *[Soy contains estrogen]({{\u003cref \"/facts/soy-contains-estrogen\"\u003e}})* for more.\n\n## 2. Dosage is hard to understand\n\nThis assertion is based on:\n\n1. How much phytoestrogen is in food varies wildly\n2. How much is safe to eat is not well understood\n\n\n### 2.1 Hard to tell how much phytoestrogen is in food\nThe amount of phytoestrogens (e.g. isoflavones) in soy based products varies wildly depending on the product, the origin of the soybeans, and the cooking method.  \n\nEven if there were a Recommended Daily Allowance, it would be quite hard to tell whether you were above or below it based on the nutritional information available.  \n\n\u003e In Canada, isoflavones [a type of phytoestrogen] in soy beans vary from 360 to 2241 mg per kg. Isoflavones content in soy beans from Romania ranged between 210 and 1340 g per kg, 1176-3309 mg per kg in USA  and 525-986 mg per kg in India. \n\u003e - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p7](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)\n\nSo even at the source the amount of isoflavones per kg can vary massively depending on the local conditions of the crop.\n\n\u003e In soy flour, total isoflavone concentrations range from 60 to 265 mg per 100 g, tofu may contain between 5.1 and 64 mg per 100 g of total isoflavones, soy milk 1.3-21 mg per 100 g, tempeh 6.9-63 mg per 100 g, soy sauce 0.1-2.3 mg per 100 g, miso 23-126 mg per 100 g and natto 20-124 mg per 100 g.  \n\u003e [...]  \n\u003e Temperature is critical for retention of isoflavones: in fact, soymilk film formed during boiling, called Foo joke or Yuba, has been reported to have 196.05 mg per 100 g of isoflavone compared to 44.67 mg per 100 g after cooking   \n\u003e [...]  \n\u003e The most refined soy foods can lose up to 80-90% of isoflavone content during processing. Soy burgers have 0.1-26 mg per 100 g of total aglycone equivalents, soy yogurts 1.6-11.8 mg per 100 g, soy drinks 1.0-21 mg per 100 g and soy cheeses 2.3-33 mg per 100 g. Usually, bakery soy-based products retain low concentration of isoflavones. Soy milk formulas may contain up to 31 mg per 100 g.  \n\u003e - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p18](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)\n\nIn other words, foods containing soy can have very unpredictable amounts of phytoestrogens, processed foods can lose a lot of their isoflavone content, and typically cooking soy based foods reduces the amount of isoflavones dramatically.\n\n\n### 2.2 How much is safe to eat is not well understood.\n\nWhile there is no RDA currently published by any body we've been able to find, there are some indications of what might constitute a dosage which would have an effect on the body.  \n\n\u003e At the same time, to have the beneficial effects of soy isoflavones, intake should be at least of 60-100 mg per day, at present not easily reached in Western countries.  \n\u003e - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p21](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)\n\nThis talks specifically about beneficial effects (which has been the focus of a lot of research due to health claims for tofu in the 1990s), the full scope of large dosages of phytoestrogens (whatever may constitute large dosages!) can have negative effects.\n\n\u003e There are also real concerns that excessive amounts of isoflavones in serum may promote other hormone-related problems.  \n\u003e - [An updated review of dietary isoflavones: Nutrition, processing, bioavailability and impacts on human health - Critical Reviews in Food Scient and Nutrition - 2017](http://web.archive.org/web/20191015205851/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Humayoun_Akhtar/publication/283791348_An_Updated_Review_of_Dietary_Isoflavones_Nutrition_Processing_Bioavailability_and_Impacts_on_Human_Health/links/5a2f732a4585155b617a45fd/An-Updated-Review-of-Dietary-Isoflavones-Nutrition-Processing-Bioavailability-and-Impacts-on-Human-Health.pdf?origin=publication_detail)\n\nand \n\n\u003e [P]hytoestrogens are also considered endocrine disruptors, indicating that they have the potential to cause adverse health effects such as infertility and increased risks of cancer in oestrogen-sensitive organs.  \n\u003e - [The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens - British Journal of Pharmacology - 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922065924/https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.13622)  \n\nThat said, the few studies that show negative effects have major drawbacks such as:\n\n1. Being performed on animals, which apart from the ethical concerns do not even necessarily yield valid results for humans!  \n2. Being performed in-vitro (i.e. in a petri-dish on small clusters of cells)\n3. Drawing conclusions from statistical (e.g. epidiemological) data which risks confusing mere correlation with cause.\n\n\n\u003e  These adverse effects have been mainly suggested based on data from in vitro, animal or epidemiological studies. Clinical studies often report the absence of adverse effects. \n\u003e - [The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens - British Journal of Pharmacology - 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922065924/https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.13622)  \n\nand\n\n\u003e Concerns about the adverse effect of soy consumption were originally based on animal data.  \n\u003e - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)\n\n\n## 3. It's unlikely you'll ingest enough to have adverse effects, but vary your protein intake anyway!\n\nHaving a varied plant-based diet is rarely bad advice. And while it seems like you are unlikely to eat enough to adversely affect your health, it's also pretty much impossible to measure how much phytoestrogen you're ingesting on a daily basis without specialised equipment. And even if you could, there are no official recommended daily allowances to stay below.\n\n\u003e Overall, the low content of bioactive compounds in second generation soy foods [(e.g. soy based mock meats)] and moderate amounts in traditional soy preparations offer modest health benefits with very limited risk for potential adverse health effects.  \n\u003e - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p21](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)\n\nAn interesting point in the same meta-analysis was:\n\n\u003e [T]o have the beneficial effects of soy isoflavones, intake should be at least of 60-100 mg per day, at present not easily reached in Western countries.  \n\u003e - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p21](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)\n\n\n\n## 4. More research is needed\nThis was repeated by _every single study_ we read. Dietary conclusions are extremely difficult to come to as they can be affected by everything from genetics of the person ingesting it, to the conditions in which the crops were grown, to even the way the food is cooked.\n\nThis article will likely be updated in the future as new studies come out. But for now the answer is a firm: nobody quite knows for sure.\n\n\u003e Despite the high intakes in Asian countries, there is still a paucity of long term data on soy consumption in Western countries. Currently, the use of soy foods in infancy, including soy-based infant formulas, was not linked to adverse events. However, absence of evidence is not an evidence of absence. With the growing adoption of vegetarian diets and with the choice of soy formulas by Western vegetarian parents, a broader characterization of the role of soy foods in Western nutrition could help the acceptance of plant-based new generation foods.  \n\u003e - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)\n\nand\n\n\u003e Having said that more rigorous studies are required to assess dose-response relationships while consuming soy food and supplementation.  \n\u003e - [An updated review of dietary isoflavones: Nutrition, processing, bioavailability and impacts on human health - Critical Reviews in Food Scient and Nutrition - 2017](http://web.archive.org/web/20191015205851/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Humayoun_Akhtar/publication/283791348_An_Updated_Review_of_Dietary_Isoflavones_Nutrition_Processing_Bioavailability_and_Impacts_on_Human_Health/links/5a2f732a4585155b617a45fd/An-Updated-Review-of-Dietary-Isoflavones-Nutrition-Processing-Bioavailability-and-Impacts-on-Human-Health.pdf?origin=publication_detail)\n\nand\n\n\u003e Given the rapid increase in global consumption of phytoestrogens and the fact that phytoestrogens are present in a wide range of dietary food supplements and widely marketed as a natural alternative to oestrogen replacement therapy, further insight into the risks and benefits of these phytoestrogens seems essential.  \n\u003e - [The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens - British Journal of Pharmacology - 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922065924/https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.13622)  \n\n\n\n\n# Vegan Society \u0026 British Association of Dietitians\n\n\u003e Evidence suggests that soya is not a threat to our health and is in fact a reliable and healthy protein source.  \n\u003e - [Vegan Society - General FAQs](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002203547/https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/general-faqs)\n\nTalkVeganToMe reached out to The Vegan Society to enquire after the sources for the evidence. The Vegan Society replied incredibly promptly and directed us to The British Association of Dietitian's as their source.\n\n\u003e There is now scientific agreement that the controversy around isoflavones’ potential to have bad side effects in humans is fuelled only by findings from laboratory or animal studies using pure isoflavones or high doses. It is well established that animals metabolise isoflavones in a different and much more efficient way to humans and results from such studies cannot be compared to any human outcomes. Additionally, using high doses of pure isoflavones cannot be compared to consuming isoflavones from whole soya foods as they provide lower quantities and are a combination of many biologically active molecules.

[p7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w)\n\nIt appears that the 46% figure is taken by using the total tonnage figures of Table 1 [p7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w) and applying the following formula.  \n\n\u003e N type tonnage * Percentage of N tonnage that is nets / Total tonnage = Percentage of total that is nets  \n\u003e 41,376 * 86% / 78,909 = 45%  \n\nWhich... is not quite 46% but it seems reasonable that we are subject to a rounding error here given we do not have the original numbers in full fidelity.  \n\n### Methodology\n\nThe study combines observations from vessel expeditions with satellite imaging [p2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w) to draw conclusions about the overall composition of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch by sampling a smaller area. Their methodology is essentially gathering all the plastic from a sample area, weighing the various types of plastic in that area is, and then multiplying those weights by the total size of the GPGP.\n\n### The majority of the rest\n\nThe National Geographic article cites 46% and then goes on to say \"the majority of the rest [is] composed of fishing industry gear\".  \nThe closest to a supporting statement for this in the study is:  \n\n\u003e  [W]e predominantly observed debris originated from marine sources [p5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w)  \n\nWhich is expanded upon later with: \n\n\u003e  [A]t least half of the collected GPGP plastics was composed of objects from marine based sources, while the relative source amplitudes considered in our model predicted that mass contributions from land-based plastics, even though lower than global average, would still dominate in these ofshore environments. This discrepancy could be due to diferences in the magnitude of certain removal processes between land-based and marine-based plastics that were not accounted for in our models. We trust that beaching is one of these processes as it may primarily remove plastics that are discarded in coastal environments through wave, tidal and onshore winds transport. Nonetheless, the GPGP dominance of marine-sourced plastics could also be attributed to their purposely engineered durability in the marine environment (e.g. strong and thick-walled nets, traps, ropes, and foats used by marine industries) as well as overestimations of land-based sources and/or underestimations of marine-based sources. [p12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w)  \n\nSo although 'at least half' are from marine sources, this _may_ be because land sources of plastic are more likely to wash up, _or_ because plastic from the land breaks up more easily as it's not designed to survive in the sea unlike marine plastics.  \nIn other words, while more than half of the observable plastic in the GPGP is from marine sources, that doesn't mean that most of the plastic going into the ocean is from marine sources.\n\n\n# Sources\n\n- [National Geographic - The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Isn’t What You Think it Is - March 2018](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/03/great-pacific-garbage-patch-plastics-environment/)\n- [Nature - Evidence that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is rapidly accumulating plastic - March 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w)\n",

In the graph it suggests that it takes 70-80L of water per 200ml of Almond Milk. Taking the middle point (75L) that gives us **375L** of water to produce 1L of Almond Milk (or 99 US Gallons per litre).  \n\nTo understand this figure better I reached out to Joseph Poore via email and ze explained that zir figures were based on an confidential Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) from an almond milk production company and based on that LCA confirmed that:\n\n\u003e [I used] the post-farm data for soymilk (almond milk processing isn’t a major user of water, so this is a good proxy)  \n\u003e - Joseph Poore - Email to Author - 2019\n\nJoseph also pointed out that there was a huge difference in the footprint between US and European sourced almonds because the Floridian almonds sourced in the US are predominantly irrigated and the Spanish almonds sourced in Europe and rainfed. For the statistics in the BBC article ze took global data for almond water usage.\n\n\n## Almond Milk vs. Cow Milk Life Cycle Assessment - Jacqueline Ho, Ingrid Maradiaga, et al. - 2016\n\nThis figure is the average of two calculations, one partly based on an industry analysis and one wholly based on a statistical model. The former is as follows:\n\n\u003e Almond production + almond processing =  \n\u003e 0.20113 kgal + 1.068555 kgal = 1.269685 kgal water / 1L almond milk  \n\u003e [Almond Milk vs. Cow Milk Life Cycle Assessment - 2016 - p13](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf)\n\nThe first figure of 201 gallons per litre of almonond milk (consumed in the growing of the almonds) is derived from [Almond Eco­Efficiency Analysis (BASF Corporation, 2011)](http://www.nsfturkey.com/newsroom_pdf/Almond_EEA_Study_Verification_Final_August_2011.pdf). The second figure of 1,068 gallons per 1 litre of Almond milk (consumed in the processing of almonds into milk) is the vast majority of the total and is rather suspect. \n\n### Almond Processing Figure\nDue to a lack of statistical data regarding almond processing, the almond processing figure (1,068 gallons of water to 1 litre of almond milk) is derived using the ratio of water usage in soybean production to soybean processing. [p11](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf).\n\nThe ratio of water usage in producing vs processing soybeans came out as 0.83x  [p11](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf) (i.e. producing the soybeans took 0.83x as much water as processing them). \n\nIt seems very strange to use a ratio of water to grow vs water to process for this, as just because almonds take more water to grow, it does not follow that they take more to process.  It seems far more likely (without evidence to the contrary) that the amount of water to process soybeans is _broadly_ similar. The amount of water used to process soybeans they cite is 136 gallons [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf). It seems staggering to believe that almonds use more than 8x as much water for processing as soybeans without any additional details on the process.\n\nThis ratio of 0.83x is then applied to 0.885 kgal for farming.  \n\n\u003e 0.82822086 = Tree nut farming / x  \n\u003e 0.82822086 = 0.885 kgal / x  \n\u003e x = 1.068555 kgal water used in processing almonds into almond milk  \n\u003e - [p13](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf) \n\nThis gives us the 1,068 gallons of water used in the processing of almonds into milk to yield to 1 litre of milk.\nBut where does the 0.885 kgal come from?\n\nThe 0.885 kgal figure was calculated using the [EIOCLA US 2002 Benchmark Producer Price Model - Tree Nut Farming](http://www.eiolca.net/cgi-bin/dft/display.pl?hybrid=no\u0026first_level_sector=-1\u0026second_level_sector=111335\u0026newmatrix=US430CIDOC2002\u0026key=7216147368\u0026value=0244216612\u0026incdemand=0.0000017858\u0026selectvect=water\u0026select_button1=Run+Model) with an input of the average retail price of almond milk per litre (1.7858$/litre) [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf). The EIOCLA is a rather clever statistical model that uses data from [a variety of public sources](http://www.eiolca.net/docs/full-document-2002-042310.pdf) to calculate the environmental impact of various industries per million dollars of the _producer_ price. \n\nTo be clear, they are using data on the amount of water it takes to grow (produce) nuts to infer the amount of water it takes to process the (already grown) nuts into milk\n\nThe dollar value input for the EIOCLA model is naturally crucial, and the tutorial for the calculator warns:\n\n\u003e The dollar value entered represents producer price - the cost to make the output; it is not the consumer price - the cost to purchase the output. For an average automobile, the producer price is around $20,000. A consumer would purchase this average vehicle for $25,000 to $30,000.  \n\u003e - [EICLA Tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20190606115219/http://www.eiolca.net/tutorial-new/tut_3.html)\n\nUnfortunately it seems that in this study, the retail price has been used, inflating the results significantly. The study justifies this by saying:  \n\n\u003e We are assuming that the cost of packaging is negligible thereby allowing us to use the retail price as the economic activity for EIOLCA.  \n\u003e -  [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf)\n\nBut this ignores retail markup, distribution costs, not to mention the fact that the dataset we're working against is for the _Tree Nut Farming_ industry [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf), not the almond _milk_ industry which skews the result due to the farming industry having a much lower 'producer price' (price the farmer/factory sells it at) by virtue of being further back in the value chain.\n\nWe therefore regard the numbers cited here for almond processing as _highly_ suspect due to:  \n\n1. The conflation of retail and producer pricing\n2. The conflation of nut milk producer pricing and nut farming producer pricing\n3. The inference of processing water usage from farming water usage (two **completely** unrelated numbers)\n4. The assumption that the ratio (0.83x) of production (farming) water usage to processing (almonds into milk) water usage from data regarding soybeans somehow applies to almonds.\n\nUsing the datasets and methodologies that the study provides it is impossible to come to a reliable conclusion regarding the total water usage per litre of almond milk.\n\n#### Speculating further\n\nOut of curiousity however, we can use the data the authors provided to make two still unsupportable, but arguably more accurate calculations for water usage per litre of almond milk. \n\n**Use soybeans' processing water usage per litre as a comparison**\n\n\u003e Almond Farming + Soybean Processing = Approximate Total gallons per litre of milk  \n\u003e   0.20113 kgal [p13](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf) + 0.136 kgals [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf) = Approximate Total  \n\u003e Approximate Total = 0.33713 kgals  \n\nSo our total would be 337 gallons of water per litre of almond milk rather than their cited 1,611. This makes the assumption that almond processing takes exactly as much water as soybean processing, but that seems a more defensible assumption than the _wild_ speculation of the figures based on the model. (See the 4 bullet points above for why.)\n\n**Use the [Almond Eco­Efficiency Analysis](http://www.nsfturkey.com/newsroom_pdf/Almond_EEA_Study_Verification_Final_August_2011.pdf) figure with the 0.83 ratio**\n\n\u003e Almond Farming Water Usage / Almond Processing Water Usage = 0.83 [p11](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf))  \n\u003e  0.2 kgals / x = 0.83  \n\u003e  x = 0.24 kgals  \n\u003e Almond Processing Water Usage = 240 gallons\n\nWhich would make our total (Almond Farming + Almond Processing): 0.44 kgallons, or 440 gallons of water to make 1 litre of almond milk rather than the cited 1,611 gallons.\n\n**Important:** The calculation above is still completely spurious and is merely an extrapolation based on the article's own unfounded assumption of a universally applicable ratio between farming water usage and processing water usage.\n\n\n# Sources\n\n- [The Guardian - Ditch the almond milk: why everything you know about sustainable eating is probably wrong - 2018](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/05/ditch-the-almond-milk-why-everything-you-know-about-sustainable-eating-is-probably-wrong)\n- [Almond Milk vs. Cow Milk Life Cycle Assessment - 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf)\n- [EICLA Tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20190606115219/http://www.eiolca.net/tutorial-new/tut_3.html)\n- [EIOCLA US 2002 Benchmark Producer Price Model - Tree Nut Farming](http://www.eiolca.net/cgi-bin/dft/display.pl?hybrid=no\u0026first_level_sector=-1\u0026second_level_sector=111335\u0026newmatrix=US430CIDOC2002\u0026key=7216147368\u0026value=0244216612\u0026incdemand=0.0000017858\u0026selectvect=water\u0026select_button1=Run+Model)\n- [Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers - Poore and Nemecek - 2018](http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/rapidpdf/360/6392/987?ijkey=ffyeW1F0oSl6k\u0026keytype=ref\u0026siteid=sci) via [josephpoore.com](https://josephpoore.com/)\n- [BBC News - Climate change: Which vegan milk is best? - 2019](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46654042)",

          "rawContent": "\n\n# Popular Fact\nThis fact appears to have become popular through the following New York Times quote from 2009.\n\n \u003e As much as 70 percent of areas newly cleared for agriculture in Mato Grosso State in Brazil is being used to grow soybeans.  \n \u003e [New York Times - The Carnivore's Dilemma - 2009](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/31/opinion/31niman.html)\n\nUnhelpfully this article provides no citation, so we are forced to consult Google which reveals a study regarding Mato Grosso we can use as reference which was published a year after the New York Times article (but does not support the 70% statistic). See the Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. metanalysis below.\n\n# Reality\n\n\u003e Recent deforestation in the Legal Amazon was predominantly due to cattle ranching not soybean expansion.  \n\u003e Globally 77% of the annual soybean harvest is fed to livestock, meaning that the vast majority of soybean production is driven by meat production.  \n\u003e - TalkVeganToMe\n\nThe above quote is a combination of the findings of the below Nature article by David M. Lapola, Luiz A. Martinelli, et al. and the USDA statistics you can find in our article [Soy Fed to Livestock]({{\u003c ref \"/facts/soy-fed-to-livestock\"\u003e}}).\n\n## Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon\n\nThis metanalysis is included as a contemporary of the New York Times quote.\n\n\u003e A more recent study by an environmental organization and a soybean trade group analyzed 250 m resolution MODIS scenes containing 630 sample areas of deforested land in Mato Grosso, and found that only 12 sample areas (0.88% in terms of area) were in soy cultivation, while nearly 200 were converted to pasture land (32% in terms of area) (Greenpeace-Brazil 2009).\n\u003e  - [Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon - April 2010](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/2/024002/meta)\n\nThe most relevant stat here is the 0.88% used for soy cultivation which is cited as [Greenpeace Brazil - Amazon Cattle Footprint. Mato Grosso: State of Destruction - 2009 - p15](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/research/amazon-cattle-footprint-mato/). However, the article itself seems to provide no breakdown, nor even mention of the 630 sample areas, or 12 sample areas being in soy cultivation. The stat actually seems to come from a [press release from Abiove](http://www.abiove.com.br/english/sustent/bs_edicao015_abr09_us.pdf) (see below).\n\nHowever, the metanalysis goes on to conclude   \n\n\u003e The proximate cause of deforestation in the Legal Amazon was predominantly the expansion of pasture, and not of soybeans. However, in Mato Grosso, an increase in soybeans occurred in regions previously used for pasture, which may have displaced pastures further north into the forested areas, causing indirect deforestation there. Therefore, soybean cultivation may still be one of the major underlying causes of deforestation in the Legal Amazon.  \n\n\u003e  - [Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon - April 2010 ](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/2/024002/meta)\n\nThis does not provide any stats however, so we are ultimately no closer to validating the 70% figure other to conclude that the research available at the time of the New Yorker suggested that: \n\n\u003e [R]ecent deforestation in the Legal Amazon was predominantly due to cattle ranching (Morton et al 2006, Brown et al 2005, Greenpeace-Brazil 2009), and not soybean expansion.  \n\u003e  - [Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon - April 2010](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/2/024002/meta)\n\n## Nature - David M. Lapola, Luiz A. Martinelli, et al. - Pervasive transition of the Brazilian land-use system\n\nTo give us some context for the trend of Brazilian Deforestation we can refer to a 2014 study published in Nature.\n\n\u003e  Despite this pressure, there has been a prominent decline in overall deforestation since 2005: from an annual average of ~18,000 km2 in the 1990–2004 period to ~10,500 km2 in 2005–2012, with the lowest rate ever of 4,571  km2 in 2012  \n\u003e - David M. Lapola, Luiz A. Martinelli, et al. - Pervasive transition of the Brazilian land-use system - p29\n\nThis gives us a reduction of 75% in the speed at which the Amazon rainforest is being deforested between the 1990s and 2012 which is useful context for understanding the context for these figures. Even more interestingly:\n\n\u003e Pastures for beef production remain the dominant land use, occupying 60% to 80% of deforested land  \n\u003e - David M. Lapola, Luiz A. Martinelli, et al. - Pervasive transition of the Brazilian land-use system - p29\n\nThe article cites this statistic as coming from the [TerraClass Land-use Database](http://inpe-em.ccst.inpe.br/en/papers/terraclass-amazon-land-use-database-2/) as of Sept 2013.\n\n## Abiove - Soy Moratorium contributes to containment of deforestation in the Amazon Biome - 2009 \n\u003e [T]he Soy Moratorium monitored this year’s crop, including a field survey, mainly by flyovers, in 630 areas that were deforested after July 2006, with the objective of checking onsite land use and occupation in the selected areas. Soy planting was identified in only 12 polygons[...]  \n\u003e The 12 polygons cover a deforested area of 2,157 hectares, of which 1,385 hectares were planted with soy. For comparison purposes, this year’s monitoring covered 157,898 deforested hectares. [...]  \n\u003e Satellite images, panoramic and close-up photographs of all 630 monitored polygons are available on ABIOVE’s site, www.abiove.com.br.

However the metanalysis by Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. above suggests it may not be the whole story.\n\n# Sources\n\n- [Mother Nature Network - Tofu-eaters please don't gloat](https://web.archive.org/web/20091105065606/http://www.mnn.com/technology/research-innovations/blogs/tofu-eaters-please-dont-gloat) \n- [Greenpeace - Eating up the Amazon - 2006](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/wp-content/uploads/legacy/Global/usa/report/2010/2/eating-up-the-amazon.pdf?53ea6e)\n- [Reuters - Cattle, not soy, drives Amazon deforestation - 2009](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN14438957)\n- David M.

Those who abstain from eating animal-based foods can eat a variety of protein-containing plant foods each day in order to get all the amino acids needed to make new protein, and also choose to incorporate complete plant proteins like quinoa and chia seeds.   \n\u003e - [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)\n\nThis means that variety is key in a vegan diet (as in any diet), to ensure you get a complete source of proteins.\n\nThe same (non-vegan) Harvard source even goes on to recommend plant protein sources over animal ones.\n\n\u003e Get your protein from plants when possible. Eating legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, whole grains, and other plant-based sources of protein is a win for your health and the health of the planet. If most of your protein comes from plants, make sure that you mix up your sources so no “essential” components of protein are missing. The good news is that the plant kingdom offers plenty of options to mix and match.   \n\u003e - [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)\n\n\n##  Resources\n- [USDA Nutrition Database](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list)\n- [Challenge 22](https://challenge22.com/)\n- [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)",

          "rawContent": "\n# Water Usage\n\n\u003e 2,500 gallons of water are needed to produce 1 pound of beef. [Cowspiracy](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)\n\n# Original Sources\n[Waterfootprint.org](https://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/product-water-footprint/water-footprint-crop-and-animal-products/) has some great stats and scholarly sources for this information.\nTheir statistic is that 15,415 litres of water are required to produce one kilogram of beef, which works out as about 1850 US gallons per pound.\n\n\u003e Most of the total volume of water (98%) refers to the water footprint of the feed for the animals. Drinking water for the animals, service water and feed mixing water account only for 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.03%, respectively.\n\nTheir primary source is [Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2010)](https://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Hoekstra-2014-Water-for-animal-products_1.pdf)\n\n# Criticisms\n\n## Comparison\nThe statistic above citing water usage is relatively meaningless without the context of what the alternative consumes.\nFortunately the [Waterfootprint.org](https://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/product-water-footprint/water-footprint-crop-and-animal-products/) article allows us to contrast on a litre-to-calorie basis, which shows that cereals (e.g. wheat, oats, barley, etc.) require 0.51 litres per kilocalorie in contrast to beef's 10.19, and chicken's 3 litres.\n\n## Grass fed meat\nAs the statistic above shows the _vast_ majority of the water consumption for animal products comes from producing the feed, carnists will often try to discredit it on the basis that it does not apply as 'water consumption' when animals are eating grass on naturally occuring plains.\n\nThe rebuttal from [Eishel, Gordon, et al.](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/33/11996.full) is worth quoting here.\n\n\u003e A possible objection to the [conclusion that beef uses 160x more land than potatoes/wheat/rice] is that beef production partly relies on pastureland in the arid west[ern United States], land that is largely unfit for any other cultivation form. [... T]he objection ignores other societal benefits those arid lands may provide, notably ecosystem services and biodiversity. It further ignores the ≈0.16 million km2 of high-quality cropland used for grazing and the ≈0.46 million km2 of grazing land [..] that can thus be diverted to food production. Even when focusing only on agricultural land, beef still towers over the other categories. This can be seen by excluding pasture resources and summing only crops and processed roughage (mostly hay and silage, whose production claims prime agricultural land that can be hypothetically diverted to other crops). After this exclusion, 1 Mcal of beef still requires ≈15 m2 land (Fig. 2A), about twofold higher than the second least-efficient [animal product] category.\n\nIn simpler terms:  \n\n1. Even if you exclude the land the cattle grazes on it uses 15 square metres of land per thousand calories to raise beef due to the harvested hay and silage (compacted grass feed). \n2. Removing the cattle from the pastureland would promote biodiversity even if it was unsuitable for growing crops.\n3. There are 0.62 _million_ square kilometeres (which is slightly larger than then entirety of France) of pastureland that are suitable for crops in the United States.\n4. We don't _need_ beef, or any other animal products to shore up our calorie or protein intake, as [acre for acre plants are on average 100 to 160 times more efficient]({{\u003cref \"/facts/land-usage.md\"\u003e}}).\n\nThe stats from the quote cite land usage, but the argument stands (though the numbers differ) for water usage.\n\n\n## Citations\n - [Eishel, Gordon, et al. \"Land, irrigation water, greenhouse gas, reactive nitrogen burdens of meat, eggs and dairy production in the United States\".

Animals are killed/stunned using methods such as electrocution, masceration, and asphyixation in a Co2 chamber, which if you want to beleive this is a humane method we suggest watching the first 15 minutes of [Dominion]({{\u003c ref \"/vegan-culture/documentaries\"\u003e}}).  \nAdditionally the stunning methods are often ineffective (see below for stats for each method). \n\n## Slaughter \u0026 Stunning Methods\n\n### Captive bolt\n\nWith this slaughter method, a 'gun' fires a metal bolt into the brain of the animal causing it to lose consciousness. This is typically used on larger animals (e.g. cows) and is fallible due to the accuracy required and the movement of the panic-stricken animals making precision difficult. According to a 2013 study: \n\n\u003e Inadequate stunning occurred in 12.5% [of cases]  \n\u003e - [Assessment of stun quality at commercial slaughter in cattle shot with captive bolt  - S Atkinson, A Velarde, B Algers - 2013 - p476](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/760f/630e835608a203f552c1ded7f7370ca02536.pdf).\n\nGiven the study was conducted with a observer present one would assume this represents a best case scenario as well, as the slaughterhouse workers will be trying to give their best impressions to comply with EU regulations.\n\nThis means that more than one in ten cattle went to be 'stuck' fully conscious, on top of the experience of queueing up to be slaughtered.\n\n### Electrical\n\nFor medium-sized animals (pigs, sheep, calves), this is performed through 'tongs' placed on either side of the animals head in order to pass a current through the brain and render them temporarily unconscious. In some cases, it can also be applied to the animal's heart in order to provide a lethal shock. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\nFor chickens, this takes the form of an 'electric bath', where chickens are hung upside down by their legs and forced into an electrified vat of water to stun them, prior to their throats being slit by a rotating blade. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\nAccording to a 2009 study conducted in Holland:\n\n\u003e Based on the observed differences in technical settings (V, Hz), and between animal differences in impedance and between animal differences in sensitivity, it is highly probable that large numbers of birds are inadequately stunned during current usage of the water bath technique in slaughterhouses.  \n\u003e - [Electrical water bath stunning of poultry.

Estimates have been made for non-reporting countries as well as for countries reporting incomplete data. However, in certain countries, data for chickens, ducks and turkeys do not yet seem to represent the total number of these birds. Certain other countries give a single figure for all poultry; data for these countries are shown under “Chickens”. [...]  \n\u003e  Data relate to animals slaughtered within national boundaries, irrespective of their origin. All data shown relate to total meat production, that is, from both commercial and farm\nslaughter. Data are given in terms of dressed carcass weight, excluding offal and slaughter fats.   \n\u003e The compilation of the data domain has been made possible by the cooperation of\ngovernments, which have supplied most of the information in the form of replies to annual\nFAO questionnaires.   \n\u003e - [FAO Methodology Document](http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/documents/QL/QL_methodology_e.pdf)\n\nTwo pieces of this are slightly confusing:  \n\n\u003e  The data on livestock numbers are intended to cover all domestic animals irrespective of their age and the place or purpose of their breeding.  \n\nThis appears to refer to a separate dataset than the one we're inspecting, i.e. 'Live animals'.  \n\n\u003e Data are given in terms of dressed carcass weight, excluding offal and slaughter fats.   \n\nAgain, this refers to a separate set of statistics within the same dataset which refer to tonnes of animal flesh, not our statistics which are 'per head'.\n\n\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [BiteSizeVegan - Quantifying Suffering, Cruelty by the Numbers](http://www.bitesizevegan.org/bite-size-vegan-nuggets/qa/quantifying-suffering-cruelty-by-the-numbers/)\n\n\n",

Diet for a New America, StillPoint Publishing, 1987, p. 352'.\n\n## John Robbins' Diet for a new America\n\n\u003e To supply one person with a meat habit food for a year requires three and a quarter acres. To supply one lacto-ovo vegetarian with food for a year requires one-half acre. To supply one pure vegetarian requires only one-sixth of an acre. In other words, a given acreage can feed 20 times as many people eating a pure vegetarian diet-style as it could people eating the standard American diet-style [Diet for a new American p344 as PDF](https://ia802904.us.archive.org/21/items/JohnRobbinsDietForANewAmerica/John_Robbins_Diet_for_a_New_America.pdf)\n\nThis in turn cites \n- Aaron Altschul - Proteins: Their Chemistry and Politics - 1965 - p264. \n\n## Aaron Altschul - Proteins: Their Chemistry and Politics - 1965\n\nDue to its age, this book was quite hard to track down. Fortunately we were able to secure a copy from the British Library.\n\n\u003e A meat and milk-based diet may require as much as 3 1/2 acres to provide one Standard Nutrition Unit.  \n\u003e [...W]hile six to seven standard Nutrition Units of a rice-and-beans diet in Japan are produced per acre. Therefore, depending upon the type of diet, the capacity of the land to support a population ranges from 20:1.  \n\u003e - Aaron Altschul - Proteins: Their Chemistry and Politics - 1965 - p264. \n\nFor a source, this cites 'Land Use and Food Production - Stamp, L.D, in Hunger: Can It Be Averted? 1961'\n\n## Land Use and Food Production - Stamp, L.D, - Hunger: Can It Be Averted? - 1961\n\nAgain this book required a trip to the British Library, and even they had to pull it from their offsite location in Yorkshire to bring it to the reading rooms.\n\n\u003e Some diets (meat and milk for example) are very extravagant of land; it may require as much as 3.5 acres to produce one [Standard Nutrition Unit (1,000,000 calories)] whereas a mainly wheat-bread basic diet requires under efficient cultivation only 0.25 acre, whilst the very intensive rice culture together with oceans in Japan produces 6-7 Units per acre. In 'carrying capacity' there is thus a range from at least 20 to 1.  \n\u003e - Land Usage and Food Production - Stamp, L.D. - Hunger: Can It Be Averted? - 1961 - p38\n\nIt is *not even vegan* because it includes fish (as per the 'together with oceans' comment).\n\nWhile there is no explicit citation, there is a note at the end of the article saying that 'Stamp, L. Dudley - Our Developing World, Faber, 1960' treats many of the topics mentioned above in more detail.\n\n## Stamp, L. Dudley - Our Developing World, Faber, 1960\n\n\u003e On each acre of farmed land - essentially on a dietary base of rice, double or treble cropped where possible, beans, sweet potatoes and other high Calorie foods - Japan can produce 6 or 7 [Standard Nutrition Units] or support that number of people per acre. Under American conditions, and with a meat-milk-fruit diet essentially extravagant of land, it takes some 2 1/2 acres or more to produce one SNU or support one person. It [sic] we then wish to stimulate an argument we can then say Japanese agriculture is 15 to 18 times as efficient as American!  \n\u003e - Stamp, L. Dudley - Our Developing World - 1960 - p113\n\nAnd here we have our original source. This page cites numbers from a table on the next page (p114)\n\n\u003e USA: 175 million population, 3.5 acres cultivated land per capita, 0.4 SNU per acre  \n\u003e Japan: 91.5 million population, 0.15 acres cultivated land per capita, 6.5 SNU per acre  \n\u003e  - Paraphrased version of table on p114 of Stamp, L. Dudley - Our Developing World \n\nAccording to the table 0.4 people can be supported by an acre of cultivated land in the USA (i.e. it takes 2.5 acres to support one person) and 6.5 people can be supported per acre in Japan (i.e it takes 1/6th of an acre to support one person)\n\nAlthough the table does not directly cite its sources elsewhere Dudley uses numbers on total food production from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation from 1948-1952 (referenced in tables on p72-p77) and the total cultivated land acreage from the UN FAO's 'Yearbook' from 1957 (referenced in tables on p40-p41).\n\nI believe zir calculation went approximately as follows:  \n\n\u003e country: total_harvest_calories / 1 SNU (1,000,000 calories) / total_cultivated_acreage = number_of_people_diet_feeds_per_acre  \n\u003e USA: ? (not cited) / 1,000,000 / 192,500,000 (inferred) = 0.4  \n\u003e Japan: ? (not cited) / 1,000,000 / 13,725,000 (inferred) = 6.5  \n\u003e - Paraphrased version of table on p114 of Stamp, L. Dudley - Our Developing World \n\nSo the 'vegan diet' which takes 1/6th of an acre is arrived at by dividing the total calorie production of Japan immediately post WWII by the number of acres of cultivated land and then further dividing that by the number of calories it takes in a year to support one person.  \nAnd the 'meat diet' of 3.5 acres seems to have been a rounded up version of the same calculation for the United States.  \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe 18-20 times land usage statistic _specifically_ is pretty untenable to quote so simplistically today for the following reasons:\n\n1. Comparing \"average diets\" is complex due to the huge variety in what people eat globally and even within the same country.\n2. This specific stat originally referred not to an average vegan diet but the average *Japanese* diet immediately post WWII\n3. The Japanese diet obviously included _fish_ and almost certainly included at least _some_ meat.\n4. Comparing meat and vegetable sources for efficiency needs to be heavily caveated with the regions the statistics were gathered from and the time period those statistics cover as these vary by region and year.\n5. The source for the food production stats are from the period 1948-1950.\n6. The original source does not unpack its exact calculations.\n7. There are much better, *much* more recent statistics we can draw upon.\n\nWe would suggest a much more supportable statement would be \n\n\u003e Beef consumed in the United States requires around 160x as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice for the same number of calories, and nearly 100x as much land for the same amount of protein.  \n\u003e - TalkVeganToMe \n\nThis information is based on the other source, 'Eishel, Gordon et al.' which you can find the details of below.\n\n### Eishel, Gordon, et al.\n\n\u003e Compared with the average resource intensities of [potatoes, wheat, and rice] per megacalorie, beef requires 160, 8, 11, and 19 times as much land, irrigation water, [GreenHouse Gas], and [Nitrogen Fertilizer], respectively, whereas the four nonbeef animal categories require on average 6, 0.5, 2, and 3 times as much, respectively.\n\u003e -  [Eishel, Gordon, et al. \"Land, irrigation water, greenhouse gas, reactive nitrogen burdens of meat, eggs and dairy production in the United States\". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Vol. 111 No. 33 June 2014](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/33/11996.full)\n\nIn simple terms, the above paragraph states that beef requires 160 times as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice per 1,000 calories. The paper does _not_ make any claims regarding the overall efficiency of an 'average' vegan or vegetarian diet with the variety of plants required to make up a nutritionally complete (not to mention interesting) diet, but the numbers are pretty staggering nonetheless.\n\nAlthough not stated in so many words, they also provide the same statistics per kg of protein which shows that **beef takes almost 100 times** (98.2x precisely) as much land as rice, potatoes, or wheat to provide the same amount of protein.  \n\nThis is calculated by dividing the mean beef kg protein per square metre\n[Eishel Gordon Et Al Supporting Information Sheet \u003e Dataset S1 Excel Spreadsheet \u003e PartitioningPerProtein](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2014/07/19/1402183111.DCSupplemental/pnas.201402183SI.pdf) and dividing it by the average of rice, wheat, and potatoes' kg protein square metre numbers. You can see in the PartitioningPerCalorie sheet that this is the same calculation performed for their 160x as much land per calorie quote.\n\n### Possible Objections\n\nThe article also goes on to address the possible objection of the numbers being 'inflated' by the cattle grazing land which is otherwise unsuitable for cultivation.\n\n\u003e A possible objection to the above conclusion is that beef production partly relies on pastureland in the arid west[ern United States], land that is largely unfit for any other cultivation form. [... T]he objection ignores other societal benefits those arid lands may provide, notably ecosystem services and biodiversity. It further ignores the ≈0.16 million km2 of high-quality cropland used for grazing and the ≈0.46 million km2 of grazing land [..] that can thus be diverted to food production. Even when focusing only on agricultural land, beef still towers over the other categories. This can be seen by excluding pasture resources and summing only crops and processed roughage (mostly hay and silage, whose production claims prime agricultural land that can be hypothetically diverted to other crops). After this exclusion, 1 Mcal of beef still requires ≈15 m2 land (Fig. 2A), about twofold higher than the second least-efficient [animal product] category.\n\nIn simple terms, even if you exclude the land the cattle grazes on it uses 15 square metres of land per thousand calories to raise beef (36.5 times as much as potatoes)! Potatoes by comparison use 0.41 square metres per thousand calories - [Referenced Supporting Information PDF - S19](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2014/07/19/1402183111.DCSupplemental/pnas.201402183SI.pdf).\n\n# Alternative Presentations\n\nThese same statistics can be found in a myriad of different forms, you can find some of them below.\n\n## A Well Fed World - Why we need plant based approaches\nA Well Fed World in Collaboration with Plantrician Project produced a graphic which states:  \n\n\u003e [On a] standard American diet: 2 football fields (1.3 acres each) feeds 1 person per year  \n\u003e [On a] plant based diet: 2 football fields feeds 14 people per year\n\nThis originates from [Plantrician Project - Food Math 101](https://web.archive.org/web/20190103163621/https://plantricianproject.org/food-math-101)\n\n## Plantrician Project - Food Math 101\n\n\u003e In order to produce the Standard American Diet (SAD), heavily comprised of animal protein and dairy, it’s estimated that the equivalent of 2 football fields are required per person per year—with much of this allocated to growing the crops to feed the animals. Source: Lappe, Frances Moore.

Unfortunately neither source is the original, and the original source does not pertain to a vegan diet at all, instead referring to post-WWII Japan (see Stamp, L.

You can see them all here: [https://imgur.com/a/n63YUZv](https://imgur.com/a/n63YUZv)\n\nWe were even briefly #41 for Reference on the iOS app store! [https://imgur.com/fO7OAj7](https://imgur.com/fO7OAj7) \n\nI was absolutely blown away by the responses (seriously if you want a case of the warm-and-fuzzies check out the link to the Facebook comments).\nI'm now feverishly beavering away to bring new content to the platform. I have started on the phytoestrogen article I mentioned last week, but that is still very much in the beginning stages so will be at least a week before that gets released I suspect!\n\nI also setup a facebook page to share content from: [https://www.facebook.com/talkveganapp/posts](https://www.facebook.com/talkveganapp/posts) where I'll be posting new stuff on a regular basis (I wonder if I should cross post from here or if that would be too much... Let me know your thoughts I'm not a facebook regular!)\n\nThanks for your continued support everyone, it's happening!\n\n# TalkVeganToMe - #11 - 14/09/19\n\nWow, your app gets released and then you naff off for two weeks? What's that about!\nLots of updates, that's what that's about!\n\nFirst let's start with what we aimed to achieve from the last newsletter:  \n\n1. ✅ Add an expanded category section rather than forcing people to scroll through categories (currently the articles towards the end of the scroll list just don't get seen!)\n1. ✅ Add favourites to allow you to easily access pages\n1. ✅ Fix bug that causes you to scroll back to the top of the page\n1. ✅ Improve search so that it's faster\n1. ✅ Improve search so that it will match pages that don't contain 100% of the words.\n1. ✅ Highlight new articles on the main page\n1. ✅ Add a Random Article button (Kinda, I just randomised the display on the front page!)\n1. ✅Next/Previous articles on the bottom of each article page\n\n100% Success rate! Love it.  \nIn addition to that I've:\n\n1. Added alert notifications of new articles\n1. Added prompt to rate the app (will help app store rankings massively)\n1. Added iPad Support\n1. Added iOS 10.3 support (previously 12.2+ was required!)\n1. Made the prompt to enable analytics prettier\n1. Fixed a bug where swapping between apps would scroll you back to the top of the page\n1. Fixed a memory leak (improved performance)\n1. Improved handling of settings updates (stopped it erasing your back button/location unnecessarily\n\nAnd I've also added automated functional testing which you can see in action here: [https://imgur.com/a/LXPD4Qo](https://imgur.com/a/LXPD4Qo)\n\nAt the time of writing notifications and prompt-to-rate are not available in the Apple App Store, only on Google Play as I finished the submission on Friday evening so it will be Monday before it's available on iOS!\nWhat's Next\nMarketing and Content!\nThe main features I wanted for the app are now done so barring any bugfixes that need to happen I can focus on getting people to use the app by cross-posting it across the internet.\n\nAs for content, the articles I'm going to start with are:\nTofu contains Estrogen \nPlants feel pain\n\nIf you've got any other articles you'd like to see, just let me know. You can see what I'm working on here: [https://trello.com/b/7ecEPfjW/talkvegantome-content]( https://trello.com/b/7ecEPfjW/talkvegantome-content)\n\nHave a great week everyone!\n\n# TalkVeganToMe - #10 - 25/08/19\n\nThis week has been an absolute rollercoaster!\nOn Sunday I had the app cleaned up enough to be ready to submit it again for approval, just to test the waters and see if it would be possible to release as a content only app (i.e. without additional functionality). \nOn Tuesday, I got another rejection, which annoyed me somewhat due to there being multiple similar apps out there and an entire reference section of the app store, but ultimately it was what I was expecting.\nI started to get quite excited about building a ingredients scanning feature into the app using AWS's text recognition API, and then having those snapshots and ingredients missing in the database appear in a \"vegan or not\" section of the app where people could swipe through photos of packaging and swipe left/right tinder style on whether they were vegan or not.\n\nTHE NEXT DAY THE APP GOT APPROVED\n\nI was in shock, I'd replied to the rejection asking for some feedback on what needed changing given it was similar to other apps that were already on the app store, but given that I waited 3 weeks for a response to my appeal last time it got rejected, I was genuinely not expecting any response at all. Let alone for it to be approved within 24hrs. BUT IT IS FINALLY LIVE!\n\n**Apple App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/talkvegantome/id1463279026](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/talkvegantome/id1463279026)  \n**Android Play Store:** [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.talkvegantome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.talkvegantome)\n\nThe UK Vegans discord people were the first to find out and gave a bunch of five star reviews on both app stores which is unbelievably helpful and I'm so grateful for their positive feedback the last few days.\n\nI also happened to notice a post on Reddit distributing an infographic that was based on the ancient land-usage data that I chimed in on to provide a better citation for, and which caused the first bit of social media exposure for the app!\n\nThere are a few more things I want to tidy up before I give it a proper social media push though:\n\n1. Add an expanded category section rather than forcing people to scroll through categories (currently the articles towards the end of the scroll list just don't get seen!)\n1. Add favourites to allow you to easily access pages\n1. Fix bug that causes you to scroll back to the top of the page\n1. Improve search so that it's faster\n1. Improve search so that it will match pages that don't contain 100% of the words.\n1. Highlight new articles on the main page\n1. Add a Random Article button\n1. Next/Previous articles on the bottom of each article page\n\nI think you get the theme here, navigation is a problem right now and content discovery is an even bigger one. Fortunately I don't think any of these are particularly hard work, I'm just going to struggle to find the time to spend on them for the next few weeks!\n\nThank you all so much for your support and ideas for the app until its release, I couldn't have done it without you.\n\nBut this is just the beginning. After this first push to clean up the app I want to focus back on content again and create more new articles that I'm as excited about as the ones I've written so far! And at some point I want to add the ingredients scanning too but... I mustn't get ahead of myself. I want the app to stand on its own legs with regards to content first.\n\nI'm SO FUCKING EXCITED everyone! I will still keep you all up to date every week just so I don't burst with excitement!\n\n# TalkVeganToMe - #9 - 18/08/19\n\nSo this week has been pretty productive.\nAs you've probably seen if you've opened the app recently there has been a complete overhaul of the interface including search!\n\n[Image 1](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/7efbe101e4e479517a32c8738/images/02c2705f-2c96-4dd9-9d19-fab61dfa14ac.png)  \n[Image 2](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/7efbe101e4e479517a32c8738/images/99f6959c-5069-4fc3-a94f-07b31dc91dd6.png)\n\nIf any of you have downloaded some of the beta updates for the Android app you will have noticed some pretty abysmal performance, particularly in search. Thankfully this has now been resolved, and the latest beta update (which is still working its way through the playstore release process) will be reflect these fixes and should be available soon.\n\nAs for next week, my availability is pretty limited but I'm going to be working mainly on tidying up the code and trying to get a release approved on the Apple App Store!\n\nWish me luck! And send feedback!!!\n\n# TalkVeganToMe - #8 - 10/08/19\n\nErm... Not going to lie there has not been a lot of progress in the weeks since my last email.  \nIf you recall, last time I wrote, the app had just been rejected from the app store and I was awaiting a response to my appeal.  \nThat was on the 20th of July, and here we are three weeks later and there has been no response at all from apple. Not even a confirmation email. I would have started to doubt that I'd even successfully sent the appeal apart from the fact that I printed the confirmation page to a pdf which explicitly states:   \nPlease note that if you self- reject or resubmit your binary in App Store Connect, your appeal will not be reviewed and this request will be canceled.\n\nWhich basically means there's no recourse or follow up, or ability to find out if they've just chucked it in the bin. I'm pretty annoyed about this because with my lack of experience with app development I don't actually know what will meet the threshold for them to allow the app on the app store. I could put another 3 months work into it and still get rejected because there's no communication about what exactly their rules are beyond some vague description of \"meaningfully different from a mobile browsing experience\". \n\nIn any case, I've been buoyed by the response from some of you suggesting new app designs to make it easier to use, and today finally got out of my rut with a flash of motiviation and frantically sketched out a new design for the app.\n\nYou can see that here: [New App Design Sketch](https://imgur.com/a/RsW63YR)\n \n(As you can tell I'm no artist.)\n\nSo I'm going to start working on that over the next few weeks, and will keep you all posted on how it goes.\n\nThe main new features will be:\n\n* Complete redesign\n* Left/right scrolling between articles\n* Search\n* Flashcards\n\nAll in all this should improve the usability of the app pretty significantly, and also add some nice features like the search and flash cards which I've been wanting to add anyway.\n\nHopefully that'll be enough to get it through to the app store! Failing that I'll have to do something more drastic!\n\n# TalkVeganToMe - #7 - 13/07/18\n\nThis week has been extremely productive!\n\n## Content\n - Anti Vegan Arguments - WIthout farming there would be no animals\n - Updated the almond milk water usage article to include recent sources\n - Added a linter to flag gendered pronouns to be replaced with ze/zir pronouns (when unsure of persons preferred pronouns)\n - Created a Media Pack page of logos and blurb\n - Added these newsletters to a Blog page\n\n## App changes\n - Added table of contents to the bottom of the page\n - Allowed pages to be displayed only on website (e.g. the media pack)\n - Reskinned the app to look a bit more like the website\n - Submitted the app for review for inclusion on the app store\n\nThat last one is a doozy as... *drumroll* the app got rejected!\n \n\u003e Guideline 4.2.2 - Design - Minimum Functionality  \n\u003e\n\u003e We noticed that your app only includes links, images, or content aggregated from the Internet with limited or no native iOS functionality. Although this content may be curated from the web specifically for your users, since it does not sufficiently differ from a mobile web browsing experience, it is not appropriate for the App Store.\n\nWhich... I can't argue with in a way because it is at its heart, a reference app, and definitely does contain all the content from the website with no additional functionality except the offline mode!  \nThat offline functionality and immediate feedback of the app is utterly critical to the whole concept of TalkVeganToMe. If you're in a pub, talking with your omni friends and mention a stat and get rebutted with \"Where's your source?\" you need to be able to come up with that quickly, easily, and reliably. If you have no internet, you're done. If you have to try and remember the name of the site, type it in, load it, you're done.\nIt's a huge difference between having this content on a website and in the app. The app came first, the website is just secondary so people can link to the content without having to download the app. \n\nAnyway, I've appealed the decision with the above reasons, so it may still get in, but we shall see!\n\nWorst case scenario I'll have to add some additional functionality to the app to make it 'differ sufficiently from a mobile browsing experience'. A few ideas spring to mind  \n\n - Fact flash cards, e.g. Shows an e-number on-screen and you hit vegan/not vegan and get a score based on success.  \n- Debate dialogue trees, an expansion on how the anti-vegan argument pages work right now, except you are presented with an anti-vegan argument, and then given options to choose from to respond with, and then get different responses depending on what you choose (a lot of work).\n\nSome-one also suggested adding in a product barcode scanning feature (to determine whether the product was vegan or not) but gathering the data for that would be a huge amount of work to make it useful for even a small percentage of the globe.\n\nI'm open to ideas! Let me know if you have anything you'd like to see in the app!\n\n# 2019-07-13\n\n## Progress this week\nThis week has actually been extremely productive! I carved out 2 days to focus on the app and do nothing else, which helped immensely. \n\nThe biggest thing is we have a newly skinned website!\n\nhttp://talkveganto.me\n\nThe website was always there, but it looked rather like a corporate intranet so I was hesitant to distribute the address too much. I'd love to say that the design was all my work, but it was thanks to the skill of some-one I hired on Fiverr that we have the design. I just took the design and applied it as a Hugo template.\n\nAdditionally, we also have a number of promotional screenshots designed! Again from some-one on Fiverr. These will go in the App Store page to make it a bit more attractive to people who are just browsing through randomly. You can see these here: https://imgur.com/a/T3mLLAC\n\nAs for articles we have:\n\n- Anti Vegan - It's too weird/counter cultural\n- Anti-Vegan - Animals are slaughtered humanely\n- Anti-Vegan - Animals aren't Sentient/Sapient\n- Facts - Animals slaughtered annually (improved to provide an explanation of how to generate figures from the UN's FAO statistics)\n\nIn fact there's only one article left in the pre-release pool!\n## Roadmap to Release\nPrior to the release I need to do the following\n\n- Write 'Anti Vegan - Without farming there would be no animals'\n- Update Almond Milk Water Usage article with latest stats\n- Proofread all articles!\n- Add tutorial to app to indicate workflow\n- Put a Table of Contents at the bottom of the page in app to make navigation easier\n- Make the app scroll back to the top of the page on navigate to new page\n- Setup talkvegantome.com in addition to .me\n- Create a media pack for the site (logos, blurb, etc.)\nAnd then it's ready to release!\n\nHonestly I'm getting quite excited, the end is in sight after a couple of month's worth of work.\nThe biggest gap currently is the marketing strategy. I think it's going to be quite hard to get the word out as I've had very limited responses to my attempts to reach out to vegan news outlets and influencers. This means I'm going to be relying on word of mouth a lot which... Is unpredictable but probably has a better chance in the vegan community as it's quite well engaged!\n\nWe'll see how it goes. I'm setting my launch expectations low so I won't be sad if it just gets 10 downloads in the first week!\n\nFingers crossed!\n\n# 2019-07-07\n\n## The Saga of 1/6th of an Acre\nI have finally found the original source for the Cowspiracy fact that 1/6th of an acre is required to feed a vegan and 3.5 acres required to feed a meat eater.\nCowspiracy (2014) cites an Earthsave article (2006) which cites a book called Diet for a new America (1987) which cites an article called Proteins (1965) which cites another article called Land Use and Food Production (1961) which cites a book Our Developing World (1960) which cites the 1948-1952 UN FAO statistics on food production to compare a JAPANESE diet (which takes 1/6th of an acre to feed one person) and an American diet (which takes 2.5 acres and got rounded up somewhere along the way).\n\nSo it's not even a vegan diet at all! The much better stat is: Beef consumed in the United States requires around 160x as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice for the same number of calories, and nearly 100x as much land for the same amount of protein. Which is sourced from a 2014 article on comparative land usage.\nOther Progress this Week\n\nI spent quite a lot of time researching the above last week as it required 2-3 trips to the British Library to fetch the ancient articles and books which weren't available anywhere else. I only managed to finish:\n\n- Anti-Vegan Arguments - One Person Can't Make a Difference\n- And made some progress but didn't release\n- Anti-Vegan Arguments - It's Okay to Kill Animals Because They Aren't Sentient/Sapient\n\nWhich is not an argument you see very often I don't think but it one that holds special value to me because it's what I believed before going vegan! \n\n## Contributions this Week\n\nI had two people reach out to me this week with suggestions for content and the app, one in particular being a very detailed set of feedback for app design which was extremely helpful!\nI can't overstate how much it means to hear from people using the app, so please keep reaching out by replying to this email, even if it's just a tiny suggestion or piece of feedback it means a great deal!\nAs always, you can see the pipeline for content on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/7ecEPfjW/talkvegantome-content)!\n\n# 2019-06-29\n\n## The Past Two Weeks\nThe past two weeks have been quiet as expected due to a week's holiday! \nI had secretly hoped to spend some time writing even on holiday, but I think for mental health's sake it's a good thing I didn't.\n\nThis week I've been figuring out how to tackle one of the biggest remaining challenges for content which is the \"Anti Vegan Arguments\" section.\nMy first attempt at this section ended up being merged into the \"Vegan Facts\" section, primarily because the format warranted a clear differentiation between \"analysis of facts\" and \"rebuttal of arguments\" and it didn't make sense to keep them under the same section.\n\nIn creating the new \"rebuttal of arguments\" vision for anti-vegan-arguments I was heavily inspired by Earthling Ed's 30 Non Vegan Excuses. In fact the original scope for this section was to reach out to Ed and ask for permission to redistribute some of the chapters. Since then however I've become more accepting of writing content for the app, and wanted to produce something unique rather than simply reword it. Especially because as the app is community based and editable by anyone, we would either have to lock Ed's chapters as immutable, or allow people to edit them, neither of which seemed good options. \n\nIn writing these pages I wanted to bring as much of the analytic rigor from the fact check pages as I could, and in my first attempt this sent me spiralling down a rabbit hole of analytic philosophy akin to my degree coursework. What the app needed though was not some 10,000 word dense philosophical analysis with a vocabulary only academics could understand, so I settled on a much simpler format that only used citations where absolutely necessary (e.g. for the facts!).\n\nThe ones I've finished so far are:\n\n- No Food is Truly Vegan\n- Personal Choice\n- Animals Eat other Animals\n\nI'm reasonably happy with what I've got so far, continuing with the summary sections at the top and splitting out the detailed analysis further down into Analytic and Emotive arguments, with no judgement intended as to the validity of either section. The purpose of these sections is purely to allow you to tailor your response to the person you're debating.\n\nPrior to release I've committed to finishing rebuttals to the following as well:\n\n- Animals are Slaughtered Humanely\n- Animals aren't 'sentient'\n- Without Farming there would be no animals\n- It's too extreme/weird\n\nIn addition, I still need to take the design from last week and apply it to the website, and get a complete marketing strategy in place. On this aspect I had some positive feedback earlier today from a vegan podcast who said they'd be interested in seeing the app when complete and would mention it as part of the podcast if they liked it, which is great news as so far I've had naff all response from other vegan news sites and influencers.\n\nAnyway, this has run extremely long, hope you've all had a wonderful few weeks and as ever, let me know if you have any ideas for the app, or any comments about the content!\n\nAs always, you can see the pipeline for content on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/7ecEPfjW/talkvegantome-content)!\n\n# 2019-06-15\n\nThis week has been much less productive for a couple of reasons. Firstly I took it as a bit of a self-care week, as I've been spending every waking moment on the app for 2-3 months now!\nSecondly, I was a bit stuck on how to get from where I am to \"released\". I've been enjoying writing articles on facts and their sources, but we have enough for the moment and writing more wouldn't actually get me any closer to released. My vision for TalkVeganToMe was not just a \"vegan snopes\" but a one-stop-shop for quick reference of:\n\n1. Rebuttals to vegan arguments\n2. Ethical purchasing advice\n3. 'Further information\". Books, films, organisations, podcasts, youtube channels\n4. Fact's sources\n\nThe first three are broadly the killer features from an app perspective. My original use case was someone in a shop (me) looking up e-numbers quickly. \nThe fourth however is probably most often going to be used in debates on social media, and not the app at all. The fourth is also probably the most compelling unique selling point. \nThat's when I realised that most likely people's first experiences with TalkVeganToMe is going to be the website, irrespective of much I am in love with the app and want them to use it.\n\nSo I came up with the following path-to-released.\n\n1. Make the website something I'm proud of.\n2. Write rebuttals to vegan arguments\n3. Polish up ethical purchasing advice\n4. Final review of all content's accuracy and legibility\n\nI'm debating adding a fifth:\n\n5. Add a search function to the app and website.\n\nI very much want this to be a feature at some point, but I don't know if it's necessary for release (i.e. if people will take one look at the app and think: unusable). Let me know what you think!\n\nAs an aside, next week is not going to be a super productive one either as I'm on holiday!\n\n\nAs always, you can see the pipeline for content on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/7ecEPfjW/talkvegantome-content)!\n\n# 2019-06-08\n\nThis week has been super productive, focussing pretty much entirely on content and investigating some really interesting stats!\n\nThis week I managed to add \n\n- Facts - Ocean Plastic is mostly nets\n- Facts - Most soy is fed to cattle\n- Facts - WHO, FDA, BDA endorsements for vegan diets\n- Facts - Almond Milk Water Usage\n- Facts - Land Usage\n- Facts - Tofu Causes Deforestation\n- Vegan Lifestyle \u0026 Culture - Defined Documentaries template\n- Vegan Lifestyle \u0026 Culture - Defined and fleshed out Organisations\n\nYou can see the pipeline for content on the Trello board.\n\nSome of these, particularly the Land Usage and Almond Milk Water Usage stats were really fascinating to explore the original sources, and uncovered some pretty egregious misrepresentations of data.\n\n# 2019-06-01\n\nThanks for signing up to the beta and downloading the app. Hopefully you've had a chance to browse around and make sure it works for you.\nProbably the first thing you'll notice is that it is light on content. I'm working hard to rectify this, but as I'm just one person this is subject to my own schedule and may end up being a touch sporadic in updates!\n\nThis week I managed to add:\n\n- Anti-Vegan Arguments - Protein\n- Vegan Statistics - Animal Life Expectancy\n- Vegan Statistics - Animal Slaughter Methods\n- How to contribute\n\nYou can see the pipeline for content on the Trello board.\nI'm always looking for new ideas, especially for stats to add, so just reply to this email with any ideas you've got and I'll add them to the board!\n",
