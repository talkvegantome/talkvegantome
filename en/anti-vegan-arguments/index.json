Lapola, Luiz A. Martinelli, et al. and the USDA statistics you can find in our article [Soy Fed to Livestock]({{\u003c ref \"/vegan-statistics/soy-fed-to-livestock\"\u003e}}).\n\n## Nature - David M. Lapola, Luiz A. Martinelli, et al. - Pervasive transition of the Brazilian land-use system\n\n\u003e  Despite this pressure, there has been a prominent decline in overall deforestation since 2005: from an annual average of ~18,000 km2 in the 1990–2004 period to ~10,500 km2 in 2005–2012, with the lowest rate ever of 4,571  km2 in 2012  \n\u003e - David M. Lapola, Luiz A. Martinelli, et al. - Pervasive transition of the Brazilian land-use system - p29\n\nThis gives us a reduction of 75% in the speed at which the Amazon rainforest is being deforested between the 1990s and 2012 which is useful context for understanding the context for these figures. Even more interestingly:\n\n\u003e Pastures for beef production remain the dominant land use, occupying 60% to 80% of deforested land  \n\u003e - David M. Lapola, Luiz A. Martinelli, et al. - Pervasive transition of the Brazilian land-use system - p29\n\nThe article cites this statistic as coming from the [TerraClass Land-use Database](http://inpe-em.ccst.inpe.br/en/papers/terraclass-amazon-land-use-database-2/) as of Sept 2013.\n\n## Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon\n\nThis metanalysis is included as a contemporary of the New York Times quote.\n\n\u003e A more recent study by an environmental organization and a soybean trade group analyzed 250 m resolution MODIS scenes containing 630 sample areas of deforested land in Mato Grosso, and found that only 12 sample areas (0.88% in terms of area) were in soy cultivation, while nearly 200 were converted to pasture land (32% in terms of area) (Greenpeace-Brazil 2009).\n\u003e  - [Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/2/024002/meta)\n\nThe most relevant stat here is the 0.88% used for soy cultivation which is cited as [Greenpeace Brazil - Amazon Cattle Footprint. Mato Grosso: State of Destruction - 2009 - p15](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/research/amazon-cattle-footprint-mato/). However, the article itself seems to provide no breakdown, nor even mention of the 630 sample areas, or 12 sample areas being in soy cultivation. The stat actually seems to come from a [press release from Abiove](http://www.abiove.com.br/english/sustent/bs_edicao015_abr09_us.pdf) (see below).\n\nHowever, the metanalysis goes on to conclude   \n\n\u003e The proximate cause of deforestation in the Legal Amazon was predominantly the expansion of pasture, and not of soybeans. However, in Mato Grosso, an increase in soybeans occurred in regions previously used for pasture, which may have displaced pastures further north into the forested areas, causing indirect deforestation there. Therefore, soybean cultivation may still be one of the major underlying causes of deforestation in the Legal Amazon.  \n\n\u003e  - [Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/2/024002/meta)\n\nThis does not provide any stats however, so we are ultimately no closer to validating the 70% figure other to conclude that the research available at the time of the New Yorker suggested that: \n\n\u003e [R]ecent deforestation in the Legal Amazon was predominantly due to cattle ranching (Morton et al 2006, Brown et al 2005, Greenpeace-Brazil 2009), and not soybean expansion.  \n\u003e  - [Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/2/024002/meta)\n\n## Abiove - Soy Moratorium contributes to containment of deforestation in the Amazon Biome - 2009 \n\u003e [T]he Soy Moratorium monitored this year’s crop, including a field survey, mainly by flyovers, in 630 areas that were deforested after July 2006, with the objective of checking onsite land use and occupation in the selected areas. Soy planting was identified in only 12 polygons[...]  \n\u003e The 12 polygons cover a deforested area of 2,157 hectares, of which 1,385 hectares were planted with soy. For comparison purposes, this year’s monitoring covered 157,898 deforested hectares. [...]  \n\u003e Satellite images, panoramic and close-up photographs of all 630 monitored polygons are available on ABIOVE’s site, www.abiove.com.br.

However the metanalysis by Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. above suggests it may not be the whole story.\n\n# Sources\n\n- [Mother Nature Network - Tofu-eaters please don't gloat](https://web.archive.org/web/20091105065606/http://www.mnn.com/technology/research-innovations/blogs/tofu-eaters-please-dont-gloat) \n- [Greenpeace - Eating up the Amazon - 2006](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/wp-content/uploads/legacy/Global/usa/report/2010/2/eating-up-the-amazon.pdf?53ea6e)\n- [Reuters - Cattle, not soy, drives Amazon deforestation - 2009](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN14438957)\n- David M.

Because we don’t store amino acids, our bodies make them in two different ways: either from scratch, or by modifying others. Nine amino acids [...] known as the essential amino acids, must come from food.   \n\u003e - [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)\n\nA concern sometimes levied against plant protein is that it's not 'complete'. \n\n\u003e plant-based foods [..] often lack one or more essential amino acid. Those who abstain from eating animal-based foods can eat a variety of protein-containing plant foods each day in order to get all the amino acids needed to make new protein, and also choose to incorporate complete plant proteins like quinoa and chia seeds.   \n\u003e - [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)\n\nThis means that variety is key in a vegan diet (as in any diet), to ensure you get a complete source of proteins.\n\nThe same (non-vegan) Harvard source even goes on to recommend plant protein sources over animal ones.\n\n\u003e Get your protein from plants when possible. Eating legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, whole grains, and other plant-based sources of protein is a win for your health and the health of the planet. If most of your protein comes from plants, make sure that you mix up your sources so no “essential” components of protein are missing. The good news is that the plant kingdom offers plenty of options to mix and match.   \n\u003e - [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)\n\n\n##  Resources\n- [USDA Nutrition Database](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list)\n- [Challenge 22](https://challenge22.com/)\n- [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)",

It takes a bonkers 1,611 US gallons (6,098 litres) to produce 1 litre of almond milk,” says the Sustainable Restaurant Association’s Pete Hemingway.  \n\u003e - [The Guardian - Ditch the almond milk: why everything you know about sustainable eating is probably wrong - 2018](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/05/ditch-the-almond-milk-why-everything-you-know-about-sustainable-eating-is-probably-wrong)\n\nThis cites [Almond Milk vs. Cow Milk Life Cycle Assessment - Jacqueline Ho, Ingrid Maradiaga, et al. - 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf), which has figures that are _highly_ suspect due to methodological concerns (see below).\n\n# Reality\n\nA reliable source has not yet been found for this statistic.\n\n# Original Sources\n\n## Almond Milk vs. Cow Milk Life Cycle Assessment - Jacqueline Ho, Ingrid Maradiaga, et al. - 2016\n\nThis figure is the average of two calculations, one partly based on an industry analysis and one wholly based on a statistical model. The former is as follows:\n\n\u003e Almond production + almond processing =  \n\u003e 0.20113 kgal + 1.068555 kgal = 1.269685 kgal water / 1L almond milk  \n\u003e [Almond Milk vs. Cow Milk Life Cycle Assessment - 2016 - p13](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf)\n\nThe first figure of 201 gallons per litre of almonond milk (consumed in the growing of the almonds) is derived from [Almond Eco­Efficiency Analysis (BASF Corporation, 2011)](http://www.nsfturkey.com/newsroom_pdf/Almond_EEA_Study_Verification_Final_August_2011.pdf). The second figure of 1,068 gallons per 1 litre of Almond milk (consumed in the processing of almonds into milk) is the vast majority of the total and is rather suspect. \n\n### Almond Processing Figure\nDue to a lack of statistical data regarding almond processing, the almond processing figure (1,068 gallons of water to 1 litre of almond milk) is derived using the ratio of water usage in soybean production to soybean processing. [p11](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf).\n\nThe ratio of water usage in producing vs processing soybeans came out as 0.83x  [p11](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf) (i.e. producing the soybeans took 0.83x as much water as processing them). \n\nIt seems very strange to use a ratio of water to grow vs water to process for this, as just because almonds take more water to grow, it does not follow that they take more to process.  It seems far more likely (without evidence to the contrary) that the amount of water to process soybeans is _broadly_ similar. The amount of water used to process soybeans they cite is 136 gallons [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf). It seems staggering to believe that almonds use more than 8x as much water for processing as soybeans without any additional details on the process.\n\nThis ratio of 0.83x is then applied to 0.885 kgal for farming.  \n\n\u003e 0.82822086 = Tree nut farming / x  \n\u003e 0.82822086 = 0.885 kgal / x  \n\u003e x = 1.068555 kgal water used in processing almonds into almond milk  \n\u003e - [p13](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf) \n\nThis gives us the 1,068 gallons of water used in the processing of almonds into milk to yield to 1 litre of milk.\nBut where does the 0.885 kgal come from?\n\nThe 0.885 kgal figure was calculated using the [EIOCLA US 2002 Benchmark Producer Price Model - Tree Nut Farming](http://www.eiolca.net/cgi-bin/dft/display.pl?hybrid=no\u0026first_level_sector=-1\u0026second_level_sector=111335\u0026newmatrix=US430CIDOC2002\u0026key=7216147368\u0026value=0244216612\u0026incdemand=0.0000017858\u0026selectvect=water\u0026select_button1=Run+Model) with an input of the average retail price of almond milk per litre (1.7858$/litre) [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf). The EIOCLA is a rather clever statistical model that uses data from [a variety of public sources](http://www.eiolca.net/docs/full-document-2002-042310.pdf) to calculate the environmental impact of various industries per million dollars of the _producer_ price. \n\nTo be clear, they are using data on the amount of water it takes to grow (produce) nuts to infer the amount of water it takes to process the (already grown) nuts into milk\n\nThe dollar value input for the EIOCLA model is naturally crucial, and the tutorial for the calculator warns:\n\n\u003e The dollar value entered represents producer price - the cost to make the output; it is not the consumer price - the cost to purchase the output. For an average automobile, the producer price is around $20,000. A consumer would purchase this average vehicle for $25,000 to $30,000.  \n\u003e - [EICLA Tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20190606115219/http://www.eiolca.net/tutorial-new/tut_3.html)\n\nUnfortunately it seems that in this study, the retail price has been used, inflating the results significantly. The study justifies this by saying:  \n\n\u003e We are assuming that the cost of packaging is negligible thereby allowing us to use the retail price as the economic activity for EIOLCA.  \n\u003e -  [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf)\n\nBut this ignores retail markup, distribution costs, not to mention the fact that the dataset we're working against is for the _Tree Nut Farming_ industry [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf), not the almond _milk_ industry which skews the result due to the farming industry having a much lower 'producer price' (price the farmer/factory sells it at) by virtue of being further back in the value chain.\n\nWe therefore regard the numbers cited here for almond processing as _highly_ suspect due to:  \n\n1. The conflation of retail and producer pricing\n2. The conflation of nut milk producer pricing and nut farming producer pricing\n3. The inference of processing water usage from farming water usage (two **completely** unrelated numbers)\n4. The assumption that the ratio (0.83x) of production (farming) water usage to processing (almonds into milk) water usage from data regarding soybeans somehow applies to almonds.\n\nUsing the datasets and methodologies that the study provides it is impossible to come to a reliable conclusion regarding the total water usage per litre of almond milk.\n\n#### Speculating further\n\nOut of curiousity however, we can use the data the authors provided to make two still unsupportable, but arguably more accurate calculations for water usage per litre of almond milk. \n\n**Use soybeans' processing water usage per litre as a comparison**\n\n\u003e Almond Farming + Soybean Processing = Approximate Total gallons per litre of milk  \n\u003e   0.20113 kgal [p13](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf) + 0.136 kgals [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf) = Approximate Total  \n\u003e Approximate Total = 0.20113 kgals  \n\nSo our total would be 201 gallons of water per litre of almond milk rather than their cited 1,611. This makes the assumption that almond processing takes exactly as much water as soybean processing, but that seems a more defensible assumption than the _wild_ speculation of the figures based on the model. (See the 4 bullet points above for why.)\n\n**Use the [Almond Eco­Efficiency Analysis](http://www.nsfturkey.com/newsroom_pdf/Almond_EEA_Study_Verification_Final_August_2011.pdf) figure with the 0.83 ratio**\n\n\u003e Almond Farming Water Usage / Almond Processing Water Usage = 0.83 [p11](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf))  \n\u003e  0.2 kgals / x = 0.83  \n\u003e  x = 0.24 kgals  \n\u003e Almond Processing Water Usage = 240 gallons\n\nWhich would make our total (Almond Farming + Almond Processing): 0.44 kgallons, or 440 gallons of water to make 1 litre of almond milk rather than the cited 1,611 gallons.\n\n**Important:** The calculation above is still completely spurious and is merely an extrapolation based on the article's own unfounded assumption of a universally applicable ratio between farming water usage and processing water usage.\n\n\n# Sources\n\n- [The Guardian - Ditch the almond milk: why everything you know about sustainable eating is probably wrong - 2018](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/05/ditch-the-almond-milk-why-everything-you-know-about-sustainable-eating-is-probably-wrong)\n- [Almond Milk vs. Cow Milk Life Cycle Assessment - 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf)\n- [EICLA Tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20190606115219/http://www.eiolca.net/tutorial-new/tut_3.html)\n- [EIOCLA US 2002 Benchmark Producer Price Model - Tree Nut Farming](http://www.eiolca.net/cgi-bin/dft/display.pl?hybrid=no\u0026first_level_sector=-1\u0026second_level_sector=111335\u0026newmatrix=US430CIDOC2002\u0026key=7216147368\u0026value=0244216612\u0026incdemand=0.0000017858\u0026selectvect=water\u0026select_button1=Run+Model)",
