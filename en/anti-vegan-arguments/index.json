Lapola, Luiz A. Martinelli, et al. and the USDA statistics you can find in our article [Soy Fed to Livestock]({{\u003c ref \"/vegan-statistics/soy-fed-to-livestock\"\u003e}}).\n\n## Nature - David M. Lapola, Luiz A. Martinelli, et al. - Pervasive transition of the Brazilian land-use system\n\n\u003e  Despite this pressure, there has been a prominent decline in overall deforestation since 2005: from an annual average of ~18,000 km2 in the 1990–2004 period to ~10,500 km2 in 2005–2012, with the lowest rate ever of 4,571  km2 in 2012  \n\u003e - David M. Lapola, Luiz A. Martinelli, et al. - Pervasive transition of the Brazilian land-use system - p29\n\nThis gives us a reduction of 75% in the speed at which the Amazon rainforest is being deforested between the 1990s and 2012 which is useful context for understanding the context for these figures. Even more interestingly:\n\n\u003e Pastures for beef production remain the dominant land use, occupying 60% to 80% of deforested land  \n\u003e - David M. Lapola, Luiz A. Martinelli, et al. - Pervasive transition of the Brazilian land-use system - p29\n\nThe article cites this statistic as coming from the [TerraClass Land-use Database](http://inpe-em.ccst.inpe.br/en/papers/terraclass-amazon-land-use-database-2/) as of Sept 2013.\n\n## Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon\n\nThis metanalysis is included as a contemporary of the New York Times quote.\n\n\u003e A more recent study by an environmental organization and a soybean trade group analyzed 250 m resolution MODIS scenes containing 630 sample areas of deforested land in Mato Grosso, and found that only 12 sample areas (0.88% in terms of area) were in soy cultivation, while nearly 200 were converted to pasture land (32% in terms of area) (Greenpeace-Brazil 2009).\n\u003e  - [Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/2/024002/meta)\n\nThe most relevant stat here is the 0.88% used for soy cultivation which is cited as [Greenpeace Brazil - Amazon Cattle Footprint. Mato Grosso: State of Destruction - 2009 - p15](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/research/amazon-cattle-footprint-mato/). However, the article itself seems to provide no breakdown, nor even mention of the 630 sample areas, or 12 sample areas being in soy cultivation. The stat actually seems to come from a [press release from Abiove](http://www.abiove.com.br/english/sustent/bs_edicao015_abr09_us.pdf) (see below).\n\nHowever, the metanalysis goes on to conclude   \n\n\u003e The proximate cause of deforestation in the Legal Amazon was predominantly the expansion of pasture, and not of soybeans. However, in Mato Grosso, an increase in soybeans occurred in regions previously used for pasture, which may have displaced pastures further north into the forested areas, causing indirect deforestation there. Therefore, soybean cultivation may still be one of the major underlying causes of deforestation in the Legal Amazon.  \n\n\u003e  - [Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/2/024002/meta)\n\nThis does not provide any stats however, so we are ultimately no closer to validating the 70% figure other to conclude that the research available at the time of the New Yorker suggested that: \n\n\u003e [R]ecent deforestation in the Legal Amazon was predominantly due to cattle ranching (Morton et al 2006, Brown et al 2005, Greenpeace-Brazil 2009), and not soybean expansion.  \n\u003e  - [Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/2/024002/meta)\n\n## Abiove - Soy Moratorium contributes to containment of deforestation in the Amazon Biome - 2009 \n\u003e [T]he Soy Moratorium monitored this year’s crop, including a field survey, mainly by flyovers, in 630 areas that were deforested after July 2006, with the objective of checking onsite land use and occupation in the selected areas. Soy planting was identified in only 12 polygons[...]  \n\u003e The 12 polygons cover a deforested area of 2,157 hectares, of which 1,385 hectares were planted with soy. For comparison purposes, this year’s monitoring covered 157,898 deforested hectares. [...]  \n\u003e Satellite images, panoramic and close-up photographs of all 630 monitored polygons are available on ABIOVE’s site, www.abiove.com.br. Total transparency.  \n\u003e - [Abiove - Soy Moratorium contributes to containment of deforestation in the Amazon Biome - 2009 - p1](http://www.abiove.com.br/english/sustent/bs_edicao015_abr09_us.pdf)\n\nThis is original research with detailed methodology and the source data is available on [abiove.com.br](www.abiove.com.br) and therefore passes as a quality source. However the metanalysis by Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. above suggests it may not be the whole story.\n\n# Sources\n\n- [Mother Nature Network - Tofu-eaters please don't gloat](https://web.archive.org/web/20091105065606/http://www.mnn.com/technology/research-innovations/blogs/tofu-eaters-please-dont-gloat) \n- [Greenpeace - Eating up the Amazon - 2006](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/wp-content/uploads/legacy/Global/usa/report/2010/2/eating-up-the-amazon.pdf?53ea6e)\n- [Reuters - Cattle, not soy, drives Amazon deforestation - 2009](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN14438957)\n- David M.

Because we don’t store amino acids, our bodies make them in two different ways: either from scratch, or by modifying others. Nine amino acids [...] known as the essential amino acids, must come from food.   \n\u003e - [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)\n\nA concern sometimes levied against plant protein is that it's not 'complete'. \n\n\u003e plant-based foods [..] often lack one or more essential amino acid. Those who abstain from eating animal-based foods can eat a variety of protein-containing plant foods each day in order to get all the amino acids needed to make new protein, and also choose to incorporate complete plant proteins like quinoa and chia seeds.   \n\u003e - [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)\n\nThis means that variety is key in a vegan diet (as in any diet), to ensure you get a complete source of proteins.\n\nThe same (non-vegan) Harvard source even goes on to recommend plant protein sources over animal ones.\n\n\u003e Get your protein from plants when possible. Eating legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, whole grains, and other plant-based sources of protein is a win for your health and the health of the planet. If most of your protein comes from plants, make sure that you mix up your sources so no “essential” components of protein are missing. The good news is that the plant kingdom offers plenty of options to mix and match.   \n\u003e - [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)\n\n\n##  Resources\n- [USDA Nutrition Database](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list)\n- [Challenge 22](https://challenge22.com/)\n- [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)",
