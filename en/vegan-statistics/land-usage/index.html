Vegetarian: 3x as much as a vegan<br />
Meat Eater: 18x as much as a vegan<br />

<p>We regard the quality of sources on the dietary comparison as poor (see below for why!) and suggest the following instead:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beef consumed in the United States requires around 160x as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice for the same number of calories, and nearly 100x as much land for the same amount of protein.<br />

<blockquote>
<p>To supply one person with a meat habit food for a year requires three and a quarter acres. To supply one lacto-ovo vegetarian with food for a year requires one-half acre. To supply one pure vegetarian requires only one-sixth of an acre. In other words, a given acreage can feed 20 times as many people eating a pure vegetarian diet-style as it could people eating the standard American diet-style <a href="https://ia802904.us.archive.org/21/items/JohnRobbinsDietForANewAmerica/John_Robbins_Diet_for_a_New_America.pdf">Diet for a new American p344 as PDF</a></p>

<h2 id="frances-moore-lappé-diet-for-a-small-planet">Frances Moore Lappé, Diet for a Small Planet</h2>

<p>The 10th edition of Diet for a Small Planet is surprisingly hard to find, and we have been unable to find anyone who provides a verbatim quote of the relevant section from the book.</p>

<p>The 1976 revised edition contains the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An acre of cereeals can produce <em>five times</em> more protein than an acre devoted to meat production; legumes (beans, peas, lentils) can produce <em>ten times</em> more; and leafy vegetables <em>fifteen times</em> more. These figures are averages; some plants in each category produce even more. Spinach, for example, can produce up to <em>twenty six times</em> more protein per acre than can beef.<br />
- <a href="https://archive.org/details/dietforsmallplan00lapp_2/page/10">Diet for a Small Planet 1976 p10</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this does not mention our 1/6th acre or 3 and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> acre figures.<br />
The closest we can find is page 405 of the 2002 edition which reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chemical, mechanized farming in the U.S. uses about three-fourths of an acre to feed one person, but the Jeavons group reports that Grow Biointensive can provide a healthy, diverse plant-food diet without chemicals using as little as one-fifth to one-tenth of an acre.<br />
- <a href="https://archive.org/details/hopesedgenextdie00lapp/page/286">Hope&rsquo;s edge: The next diet for a small planet 2002 - p405</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not exactly the 1/6th figure that John Robbins cites, but it&rsquo;s certainly the closest we can find. <a href="http://www.growbiointensive.org/about_history.html">Grow Biointensive</a> looks to be an organisation about intensive crop farming on a small scale, so they are likely the original source of the statistic from a plant-based side at least.<br />
Their <a href="http://www.growbiointensive.org/FAQ/FAQ_RawFood.html">FAQ</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A complete diet for one person realistically takes 4,000 sq ft, when grown at GROW BIOINTENSIVE® intermediate yields.<br />
- <a href="http://www.growbiointensive.org/FAQ/FAQ_RawFood.html">Grow Biointensive FAQ - Raw Food</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>4,000 sqft = 0.91 acres, which is <em>still</em> not our 1/6th, 1/5th, or 1/10th figures, but the FAQ is from 2010 and the closest citation we can find from Frances Moore Lappé is from 2002, so changes are understandable.</p>

<p>Here we are firmly past the pale of charitable interpretation though. We definitely do not have a reliable original source even for the one-sixth figure for a plant based diet, much less the three and a quarter acres that a meat eater requires! The closest the Grow Biointensive site has is the page on livestock which states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Generally, in conventional farming, two gallons of milk daily may be produced by one cow (or two goats) on about one acre (43,560 sq. ft.)
- <a href="http://www.growbiointensive.org/FAQ/FAQ_Livestock.html">Grow Biointensive FAQ - Livestock</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately this is both unsourced and does not make any claims about what a typical meat eating diet requires, just provides figures based on individual animal requirements and so our journey ends unresolved and on a tangent.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The 18-20 times land usage statistic <em>specifically</em> is pretty untenable to quote so simplisticly today for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Comparing &ldquo;average diets&rdquo; is complex due to the huge variety in what people eat globally and even within the same country.</li>
<li>Comparing meat and vegetable sources for efficiency needs to be heavily caveated with the regions the statistics were gathered from and the time period those statistics cover as these vary by region and year.</li>
<li>The source is from 1981 (so far as we can trace it with accuracy, but the original source of information if it is indeed from Grow Biointesive may go back to the 1970s as the organisation was formed in &lsquo;72).</li>
<li>There are much better, much more recent statistics we can draw upon.</li>
</ol>

<p>We would suggest a much more supportable statement would be</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beef consumed in the United States requires around 160x as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice for the same number of calories, and nearly 100x as much land for the same amount of protein.<br />
- TalkVeganToMe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This information is based on the other source, &lsquo;Eishel, Gordon et al.&rsquo; which you can find the details of below.</p>

<h3 id="eishel-gordon-et-al">Eishel, Gordon, et al.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Compared with the average resource intensities of [potatoes, wheat, and rice] per megacalorie, beef requires 160, 8, 11, and 19 times as much land, irrigation water, [GreenHouse Gas], and [Nitrogen Fertilizer], respectively, whereas the four nonbeef animal categories require on average 6, 0.5, 2, and 3 times as much, respectively.
-  <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/33/11996.full">Eishel, Gordon, et al. &ldquo;Land, irrigation water, greenhouse gas, reactive nitrogen burdens of meat, eggs and dairy production in the United States&rdquo;. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Vol. 111 No. 33 June 2014</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In simple terms, the above paragraph states that beef requires 160 times as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice per 1,000 calories. The paper does <em>not</em> make any claims regarding the overall efficiency of an &lsquo;average&rsquo; vegan or vegetarian diet with the variety of plants required to make up a nutritionally complete (not to mention interesting) diet, but the numbers are pretty staggering nonetheless.</p>

<p>Although not stated in so many words, they also provide the same statistics per kg of protein which shows that <strong>beef takes almost 100 times</strong> (98.2x precisely) as much land as rice, potatoes, or wheat to provide the same amount of protein.</p>

<p>This is calculated by dividing the mean beef kg protein per square metre
<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2014/07/19/1402183111.DCSupplemental/pnas.201402183SI.pdf">Eishel Gordon Et Al Supporting Information Sheet &gt; Dataset S1 Excel Spreadsheet &gt; PartitioningPerProtein</a> and dividing it by the average of rice, wheat, and potatoes&rsquo; kg protein square metre numbers. You can see in the PartitioningPerCalorie sheet that this is the same calculation performed for their 160x as much land per calorie quote.</p>

<h3 id="possible-objections">Possible Objections</h3>

<p>The article also goes on to address the possible objection of the numbers being &lsquo;inflated&rsquo; by the cattle grazing land which is otherwise unsuitable for cultivation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A possible objection to the above conclusion is that beef production partly relies on pastureland in the arid west[ern United States], land that is largely unfit for any other cultivation form. [&hellip; T]he objection ignores other societal benefits those arid lands may provide, notably ecosystem services and biodiversity. It further ignores the ≈0.16 million km2 of high-quality cropland used for grazing and the ≈0.46 million km2 of grazing land [..] that can thus be diverted to food production. Even when focusing only on agricultural land, beef still towers over the other categories. This can be seen by excluding pasture resources and summing only crops and processed roughage (mostly hay and silage, whose production claims prime agricultural land that can be hypothetically diverted to other crops). After this exclusion, 1 Mcal of beef still requires ≈15 m2 land (Fig. 2A), about twofold higher than the second least-efficient [animal product] category.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In simple terms, even if you exclude the land the cattle grazes on it uses 15 square metres of land per thousand calories to raise beef (36.5 times as much as potatoes)! Poatoes by comparison use 0.41 square metres per thousand calories - <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2014/07/19/1402183111.DCSupplemental/pnas.201402183SI.pdf">Referenced Supporting Information PDF - S19</a>.</p>
