(See the section on the USDA below for more information.)\n\n## Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies\n\n\u003e 80% of Amazon soy is destined for animal feed\n\u003e - [Global Forest Atlas - Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies](https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/land-use/soy)\n\nYale links to a [Greenpeace Article](http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/research/eating-up-the-amazon/).\nWhich in turn cites 'Worldwatch Institute (2006)', which appears to refer to [State of the World 2006 - Worldwatch Institute](https://archive.org/details/stateofworld200600nier)\n\n## State of the World 2006 - Worldwatch Institute\n\n\u003e [W]orldwide, nearly 80 percent of all soybeans are used for animal feed.  \n\u003e - [State of the World 2006 - Worldwatch Institute - p30](https://archive.org/details/stateofworld200600nier)\n\nThis in turn cites 'Mark Ash, Economic Research Service, USDA, e-mail to author, May 2005'.  \n\n## USDA World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates\n\nI reached out to Mr Ash from the USDA Economic Research Service myself and he replied (_incredibly_ quickly) saying that he would most likely have used the [USDA’s Production, Supply and Distribution database](https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/app/index.html#/app/advQuery) or the [Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report](https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/index.htm) as sources for this statistic and that furthermore:  \n\n\u003e  If the question really is how much soybean meal is consumed for feed from the processing of soybeans, then the percentage is closer to 77 percent.\n\nIn order to calculate the figure, you take the world total use for soybean meal (232.74 million metric tons) [WASDE May 2019 - p29](https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/wasde0519.pdf) and divide it by the world domestic crush for soybeans (301.63 million metric tons) [WASDE May 2019- p28](https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/wasde0519.pdf) which gives you 77%.  \nAccording to Mr Ash, nearly all of the domestic use of soybean meal is for animal feed.\n\nHere we are comparing statistics about global **soybean** production vs global **soybean meal** consumption. The amount of meal consumed by ton is 77% of the total soybean production globally. Assuming that only trace amounts of soybean meal is used for anything other than animal feed (as suggested by Mr Ash, an expert in the field), we can rest our figure for animal feed consumption at 77% of total global soybean production.\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Global Forest Atlas - Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies](https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/land-use/soy)\n- [Greenpeace - Eating up the Amazon](http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/research/eating-up-the-amazon/)\n- [State of the World 2006 - Worldwatch Institute](https://archive.org/details/stateofworld200600nier)\n- [USDA’s Production, Supply and Distribution Database](https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/app/index.html#/app/advQuery)\n- [World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates Reports](https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/index.htm) \n- [World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates - May 2019](https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/wasde0519.pdf)",

[Cowspiracy](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)\n\n# Original Sources\n[Waterfootprint.org](https://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/product-water-footprint/water-footprint-crop-and-animal-products/) has some great stats and scholarly sources for this information.\nTheir statistic is that 15,415 litres of water are required to produce one kilogram of beef, which works out as about 1850 US gallons per pound.\n\n\u003e Most of the total volume of water (98%) refers to the water footprint of the feed for the animals. Drinking water for the animals, service water and feed mixing water account only for 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.03%, respectively.\n\nTheir primary source is [Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2010)](https://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Hoekstra-2014-Water-for-animal-products_1.pdf)\n\n# Criticisms\n\n## Comparison\nThe statistic above citing water usage is relatively meaningless without the context of what the alternative consumes.\nFortunately the [Waterfootprint.org](https://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/product-water-footprint/water-footprint-crop-and-animal-products/) article allows us to contrast on a litre-to-calorie basis, which shows that cereals (e.g. wheat, oats, barley, etc.) require 0.51 litres per kilocalorie in contrast to beef's 10.19, and chicken's 3 litres.\n\n## Grass fed meat\nAs the statistic above shows the _vast_ majority of the water consumption for animal products comes from producing the feed, carnists will often try to discredit it on the basis that it does not apply as 'water consumption' when animals are eating grass on naturally occuring plains.\n\nThe rebuttal from [Eishel, Gordon, et al.](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/33/11996.full) is worth quoting here.\n\n\u003e A possible objection to the [conclusion that beef uses 160x more land than potatoes/wheat/rice] is that beef production partly relies on pastureland in the arid west[ern United States], land that is largely unfit for any other cultivation form. [... T]he objection ignores other societal benefits those arid lands may provide, notably ecosystem services and biodiversity. It further ignores the ≈0.16 million km2 of high-quality cropland used for grazing and the ≈0.46 million km2 of grazing land [..] that can thus be diverted to food production. Even when focusing only on agricultural land, beef still towers over the other categories. This can be seen by excluding pasture resources and summing only crops and processed roughage (mostly hay and silage, whose production claims prime agricultural land that can be hypothetically diverted to other crops). After this exclusion, 1 Mcal of beef still requires ≈15 m2 land (Fig. 2A), about twofold higher than the second least-efficient [animal product] category.\n\nIn simpler terms:  \n\n1. Even if you exclude the land the cattle grazes on it uses 15 square metres of land per thousand calories to raise beef due to the harvested hay and silage (compacted grass feed). \n2. Removing the cattle from the pastureland would promote biodiversity even if it was unsuitable for growing crops.\n3. There are 0.62 _million_ square kilometeres (which is slightly larger than then entirety of France) of pastureland that are suitable for crops in the United States.\n4. We don't _need_ beef, or any other animal products to shore up our calorie or protein intake, as [acre for acre plants are on average 100 to 160 times more efficient]({{\u003cref \"/vegan-statistics/land-usage.md\"\u003e}}).\n\nThe stats from the quote cite land usage, but the argument stands (though the numbers differ) for water usage.\n\n\n## Citations\n - [Eishel, Gordon, et al. \"Land, irrigation water, greenhouse gas, reactive nitrogen burdens of meat, eggs and dairy production in the United States\".

As such we have split this section into groups on a country by country basis.  \n\n## Slaughter \u0026 Stunning Methods\n\n### Captive bolt\nWith this slaughter method, a 'gun' fires a metal bolt into the brain of the animal causing it to lose consciousness. This is typically used on larger animals (e.g. cows) and is fallible due to the accuracy required and the movement of the panic-stricken animals making precision difficult.\n\n### Electrical\n\nFor medium-sized animals (pigs, sheep, calves), this is performed through 'tongs' placed on either side of the animals head in order to pass a current through the brain and render them temporarily unconscious. In some cases, it can also be applied to the animal's heart in order to provide a lethal shock. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\nFor chickens, this takes the form of an 'electric bath', where chickens are hung upside down by their legs and forced into an electrified vat of water to stun them, prior to their throats being slit by a rotating blade. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\n### Gas\n\nAnimals are lowered into a chamber of a high-CO2 mixture for up to five minutes [HSA.org.uk](https://www.hsa.org.uk/gaseous-methods/gaseous-methods) in order to ensure their death.\n\n### Sticking\n\nUsed for larger animals, this is the process of hoisting the animal by the back legs and slicing its neck to sever large arteries to ensure the animal dies of blood loss. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\n# United Kingdom\n\n\u003e Current law requires animals to be stunned before slaughter - rendering them insensible to pain until death supervenes.

[Grow Biointensive](http://www.growbiointensive.org/about_history.html) looks to be an organisation about intensive crop farming on a small scale, so they are likely the original source of the statistic from a plant-based side at least.  \nTheir [FAQ](http://www.growbiointensive.org/FAQ/FAQ_RawFood.html) states:\n\n\u003e A complete diet for one person realistically takes 4,000 sq ft, when grown at GROW BIOINTENSIVE® intermediate yields.  \n\u003e - [Grow Biointensive FAQ - Raw Food](http://www.growbiointensive.org/FAQ/FAQ_RawFood.html)\n\n4,000 sqft = 0.91 acres, which is _still_ not our 1/6th, 1/5th, or 1/10th figures, but the FAQ is from 2010 and the closest citation we can find from Frances Moore Lappé is from 2002, so changes are understandable.\n\nHere we are firmly past the pale of charitable interpretation though. We definitely do not have a reliable original source even for the one-sixth figure for a plant based diet, much less the three and a quarter acres that a meat eater requires! The closest the Grow Biointensive site has is the page on livestock which states:\n\n\u003e Generally, in conventional farming, two gallons of milk daily may be produced by one cow (or two goats) on about one acre (43,560 sq. ft.)\n\u003e - [Grow Biointensive FAQ - Livestock](http://www.growbiointensive.org/FAQ/FAQ_Livestock.html)\n\nUnfortunately this is both unsourced and does not make any claims about what a typical meat eating diet requires, just provides figures based on individual animal requirements and so our journey ends unresolved and on a tangent.\n\nIf anyone is able to provide access to the relevant original source (the 10th Anniversary edition, p69) please [contact us](https://talkvegantome.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe 18-20 times land usage statistic _specifically_ is pretty untenable to quote so simplisticly today for the following reasons:\n\n1. Comparing \"average diets\" is complex due to the huge variety in what people eat globally and even within the same country.\n2. Comparing meat and vegetable sources for efficiency needs to be heavily caveated with the regions the statistics were gathered from and the time period those statistics cover as these vary by region and year.\n3. The source is from 1981 (so far as we can trace it with accuracy, but the original source of information if it is indeed from Grow Biointesive may go back to the 1970s as the organisation was formed in '72).\n4. There are much better, much more recent statistics we can draw upon.\n\nWe would suggest a much more supportable statement would be \n\n\u003e Beef consumed in the United States requires around 160x as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice for the same number of calories, and nearly 100x as much land for the same amount of protein.  \n\u003e - TalkVeganToMe \n\nThis information is based on the other source, 'Eishel, Gordon et al.' which you can find the details of below.\n\n### Eishel, Gordon, et al.\n\n\u003e Compared with the average resource intensities of [potatoes, wheat, and rice] per megacalorie, beef requires 160, 8, 11, and 19 times as much land, irrigation water, [GreenHouse Gas], and [Nitrogen Fertilizer], respectively, whereas the four nonbeef animal categories require on average 6, 0.5, 2, and 3 times as much, respectively.\n\u003e -  [Eishel, Gordon, et al. \"Land, irrigation water, greenhouse gas, reactive nitrogen burdens of meat, eggs and dairy production in the United States\". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Vol. 111 No. 33 June 2014](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/33/11996.full)\n\nIn simple terms, the above paragraph states that beef requires 160 times as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice per 1,000 calories. The paper does _not_ make any claims regarding the overall efficiency of an 'average' vegan or vegetarian diet with the variety of plants required to make up a nutritionally complete (not to mention interesting) diet, but the numbers are pretty staggering nonetheless.\n\nAlthough not stated in so many words, they also provide the same statistics per kg of protein which shows that **beef takes almost 100 times** (98.2x precisely) as much land as rice, potatoes, or wheat to provide the same amount of protein.  \n\nThis is calculated by dividing the mean beef kg protein per square metre\n[Eishel Gordon Et Al Supporting Information Sheet \u003e Dataset S1 Excel Spreadsheet \u003e PartitioningPerProtein](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2014/07/19/1402183111.DCSupplemental/pnas.201402183SI.pdf) and dividing it by the average of rice, wheat, and potatoes' kg protein square metre numbers. You can see in the PartitioningPerCalorie sheet that this is the same calculation performed for their 160x as much land per calorie quote.\n\n### Possible Objections\n\nThe article also goes on to address the possible objection of the numbers being 'inflated' by the cattle grazing land which is otherwise unsuitable for cultivation.\n\n\u003e A possible objection to the above conclusion is that beef production partly relies on pastureland in the arid west[ern United States], land that is largely unfit for any other cultivation form. [... T]he objection ignores other societal benefits those arid lands may provide, notably ecosystem services and biodiversity. It further ignores the ≈0.16 million km2 of high-quality cropland used for grazing and the ≈0.46 million km2 of grazing land [..] that can thus be diverted to food production. Even when focusing only on agricultural land, beef still towers over the other categories. This can be seen by excluding pasture resources and summing only crops and processed roughage (mostly hay and silage, whose production claims prime agricultural land that can be hypothetically diverted to other crops). After this exclusion, 1 Mcal of beef still requires ≈15 m2 land (Fig. 2A), about twofold higher than the second least-efficient [animal product] category.\n\nIn simple terms, even if you exclude the land the cattle grazes on it uses 15 square metres of land per thousand calories to raise beef (36.5 times as much as potatoes)! Poatoes by comparison use 0.41 square metres per thousand calories - [Referenced Supporting Information PDF - S19](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2014/07/19/1402183111.DCSupplemental/pnas.201402183SI.pdf).\n\n\n## Citations\n\n-  [Eishel, Gordon, et al. \"Land, irrigation water, greenhouse gas, reactive nitrogen burdens of meat, eggs and dairy production in the United States\".
