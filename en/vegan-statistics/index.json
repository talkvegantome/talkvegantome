As with any diet, it is possible to become nutritionally deficient on a vegan diet if it's not suitably varied, supplemented, or if there are additional health concerns.  \nIf you have any questions about planning your diet, seek out the expertise of a registered dietician or appropriate health professional as licenced in your country.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [American Dietetic Association](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)\n- [NHS UK](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/healthy-eating-vegetarians-vegans/)\n- [Vegan Society on Nutrition](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health)\n- [British Dietetic Association - Vegan Society Memorandum](https://www.bda.uk.com/about/workwithus/bda_and_vegan_society_mou)\n- [British Dietetic Association - Plant Based Diets](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/plant-based_diet)\n- [WHO - Feeding and nutrition of infants and young children](http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/98302/WS_115_2000FE.pdf)\n- [WHO - Infant and young child feeding](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/infant-and-young-child-feeding)",

Drinking water for the animals, service water and feed mixing water account only for 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.03%, respectively.\n\nTheir primary source is [Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2010)](https://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Hoekstra-2014-Water-for-animal-products_1.pdf)\n\n# Criticisms\n\n## Comparison\nThe statistic above citing water usage is relatively meaningless without the context of what the alternative consumes.\nFortunately the [Waterfootprint.org](https://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/product-water-footprint/water-footprint-crop-and-animal-products/) article allows us to contrast on a litre-to-calorie basis, which shows that cereals (e.g. wheat, oats, barley, etc.) require 0.51 litres per kilocalorie in contrast to beef's 10.19, and chicken's 3 litres.\n\n## Grass fed meat\nAs the statistic above shows the _vast_ majority of the water consumption for animal products comes from producing the feed, carnists will often try to discredit it on the basis that it does not apply as 'water consumption' when animals are eating grass on naturally occuring plains.  The trite rebuttal to this is to enquire precisely what percentage of their consumption is grass fed on naturally occuring plains.",

As such we have split this section into groups on a country by country basis.  \n\n## Slaughter \u0026 Stunning Methods\n\n### Captive bolt\nWith this slaughter method, a 'gun' fires a metal bolt into the brain of the animal causing it to lose consciousness. This is typically used on larger animals (e.g. cows) and is fallible due to the accuracy required and the movement of the panic-stricken animals making precision difficult.\n\n### Electrical\n\nFor medium-sized animals (pigs, sheep, calves), this is performed through 'tongs' placed on either side of the animals head in order to pass a current through the brain and render them temporarily unconscious. In some cases, it can also be applied to the animal's heart in order to provide a lethal shock. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\nFor chickens, this takes the form of an 'electric bath', where chickens are hung upside down by their legs and forced into an electrified vat of water to stun them, prior to their throats being slit by a rotating blade. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\n### Gas\n\nAnimals are lowered into a chamber of a high-CO2 mixture for up to five minutes [HSA.org.uk](https://www.hsa.org.uk/gaseous-methods/gaseous-methods) in order to ensure their death.\n\n### Sticking\n\nUsed for larger animals, this is the process of hoisting the animal by the back legs and slicing its neck to sever large arteries to ensure the animal dies of blood loss. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\n# United Kingdom\n\n\u003e Current law requires animals to be stunned before slaughter - rendering them insensible to pain until death supervenes.

Comparing \"average diets\" is complex due to the huge variety in what people eat globally and even within the same country.\n2. Comparing meat and vegetable sources for efficiency needs to be heavily caveated with the regions the statistics were gathered from and the time period those statistics cover as these vary by region and year.\n3. The source is from 1981 (so far as we can trace it, Frances' source may be even older).\n4. There are much better, much more recent statistics we can draw upon.\n\nWe would suggest a much more supportable statement would be \n\n\u003e Beef requires 160x as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice for the same number of calories, and nearly 100x as much for the same amount of protein.\n\nThis information is based on the other source, 'Eishel, Gordon et al.' which you can find the details of below.\n\n### Eishel, Gordon, et al.\n\n\u003e Compared with the average resource intensities of [potatoes, wheat, and rice] per megacalorie, beef requires 160, 8, 11, and 19 times as much land, irrigation water, [GreenHouse Gas], and [Nitrogen Fertilizer], respectively, whereas the four nonbeef animal categories require on average 6, 0.5, 2, and 3 times as much, respectively.\n\u003e -  [Eishel, Gordon, et al. \"Land, irrigation water, greenhouse gas, reactive nitrogen burdens of meat, eggs and dairy production in the United States\". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Vol. 111 No. 33 June 2014](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/33/11996.full)\n\nIn simple terms, the above paragraph states that beef requires 160 times as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice per 1,000 calories. The paper does _not_ make any claims regarding the overall efficiency of an 'average' vegan or vegetarian diet with the variety of plants required to make up a nutritionally complete (not to mention interesting) diet, but the numbers are pretty staggering nonetheless.\n\nAlthough not stated in so many words, they also provide the same statistics per kg of protein which shows that **beef takes almost 100 times** (98.2x precisely) as much land as rice, potatoes, or wheat to provide the same amount of protein.  \n\nThis is calculated by dividing the mean beef kg protein per square metre\n[Eishel Gordon Et Al Supporting Information Sheet \u003e Dataset S1 Excel Spreadsheet \u003e PartitioningPerProtein](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2014/07/19/1402183111.DCSupplemental/pnas.201402183SI.pdf) and dividing it by the average of rice, wheat, and potatoes' kg protein square metre numbers. You can see in the PartitioningPerCalorie sheet that this is the same calculation performed for their 160x as much land per calorie quote.\n\n### Possible Objections\n\nThe article also goes on to address the possible objection of the numbers being 'inflated' by the cattle grazing land which is otherwise unsuitable for cultivation.\n\n\u003e A possible objection to the above conclusion is that beef production partly relies on pastureland in the arid west[ern United States], land that is largely unfit for any other cultivation form. [... T]he objection ignores other societal benefits those arid lands may provide, notably ecosystem services and biodiversity. It further ignores the ≈0.16 million km2 of high-quality cropland used for grazing and the ≈0.46 million km2 of grazing land [..] that can thus be diverted to food production. Even when focusing only on agricultural land, beef still towers over the other categories. This can be seen by excluding pasture resources and summing only crops and processed roughage (mostly hay and silage, whose production claims prime agricultural land that can be hypothetically diverted to other crops). After this exclusion, 1 Mcal of beef still requires ≈15 m2 land (Fig. 2A), about twofold higher than the second least-efficient [animal product] category.\n\nIn simple terms, even if you exclude the land the cattle grazes on it uses 15 square metres of land per thousand calories to raise beef (36.5 times as much as potatoes)! Poatoes by comparison use 0.41 square metres per thousand calories - [Referenced Supporting Information PDF - S19](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2014/07/19/1402183111.DCSupplemental/pnas.201402183SI.pdf).\n\n\n## Citations\n\n-  [Eishel, Gordon, et al. \"Land, irrigation water, greenhouse gas, reactive nitrogen burdens of meat, eggs and dairy production in the United States\".
