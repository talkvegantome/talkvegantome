[Cowspiracy](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)\n\n# Original Sources\n[Waterfootprint.org](https://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/product-water-footprint/water-footprint-crop-and-animal-products/) has some great stats and scholarly sources for this information.\nTheir statistic is that 15,415 litres of water are required to produce one kilogram of beef, which works out as about 1850 US gallons per pound.\n\n\u003e Most of the total volume of water (98%) refers to the water footprint of the feed for the animals. Drinking water for the animals, service water and feed mixing water account only for 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.03%, respectively.\n\nTheir primary source is [Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2010)](https://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Hoekstra-2014-Water-for-animal-products_1.pdf)\n\n# Criticisms\n\n## Comparison\nThe statistic above citing water usage is relatively meaningless without the context of what the alternative consumes.\nFortunately the [Waterfootprint.org](https://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/product-water-footprint/water-footprint-crop-and-animal-products/) article allows us to contrast on a litre-to-calorie basis, which shows that cereals (e.g. wheat, oats, barley, etc.) require 0.51 litres per kilocalorie in contrast to beef's 10.19, and chicken's 3 litres.\n\n## Grass fed meat\nAs the statistic above shows the _vast_ majority of the water consumption for animal products comes from producing the feed, carnists will often try to discredit it on the basis that it does not apply as 'water consumption' when animals are eating grass on naturally occuring plains.  The trite rebuttal to this is to enquire precisely what percentage of their consumption is grass fed on naturally occuring plains.",

As such we have split this section into groups on a country by country basis. \n\n## Slaughter \u0026 Stunning Methods\n\n### Captive bolt\nWith this slaughter method a 'gun' fires a metal bolt into the brain of the animal causing it to lose consciousness. This is typically used on larger animals (e.g. cows) and is fallible due to the accuracy required and the movement of the panic stricken animals making precision difficult.\n\n### Electrical\n\nFor medium sized animals (pigs, sheep, calves), this is performed through 'tongs' placed on either side of the animals head in order to pass a current through the brain and render them temporarily unconscious. In some cases it can also be applied to the animals heart in order to provide a lethal shock. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\nFor chickens, this takes the form of an 'electric bath', where chickens are hung upside down by their legs and forced into an electrified vat of water to stun them, prior to their throats being slit by a rotating blade. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\n### Gas\n\nAnimals are lowered into a chamber of a high-CO2 mixture for up to five minutes [HSA.org.uk](https://www.hsa.org.uk/gaseous-methods/gaseous-methods) in order to ensure their death.\n\n### Sticking\n\nUsed for larger animals, this is the process of hoisting the animal by the back legs and slicing the its neck to sever large arteries to ensure the animal dies of blood loss. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\n# United Kingdom\n\n\u003e Current law requires animals to be stunned before slaughter - rendering them insensible to pain until death supervenes. However, exemptions are allowed that permit non-stun slaughter for religious purposes, i.e. Muslim and Jewish communities.   \n[RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/getinvolved/campaign/slaughter)\n\n## Legal Methods\n\n- Gas (Pigs and ['the majority of poultry'](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile))\n- Captive Bolt [RSPCA UK]((https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile))\n- Mechanical neck cutter (poultry) [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\n\n# Additional Sources\n[Temple Grandin - Carbon Dioxide Stunning](https://www.grandin.com/humane/carbon.stun.html)",
