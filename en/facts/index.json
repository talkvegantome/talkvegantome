Furthermore, although the phytoestrogen content in animal products is low when compared to soy-based foods (e.g., soy milk), the range is similar to that of many commonly consumed vegetables.  \n\u003e -  [Phytoestrogen Content of Foods of Animal Origin: Dairy Products, Eggs, Meat, Fish, and Seafood - Journal of Agricultural Food Chemistry - 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20191020110539/https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jf801344x)\n\n### What isoflavones does soy contain?\n\u003e Soy contains the isoflavones:  \n\u003e - Biochanin A   \n\u003e - Clycitein   \n\u003e - Daidzein  \n\u003e - Formononetin  \n\u003e - Genistein    \n\u003e - [The pros and cons of phytoestrogens - Front Neuroendocrinol - 2010 - p2](https://web.archive.org/web/20190928181945/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3074428/pdf/nihms271669.pdf)\n\n## How do isoflavones interact with the body?\n\u003e Some isoflavones, most notably genistein, inhibit pathways important for cell growth and proliferation, an effect which affects multiple organ systems.  \n\u003e - [The pros and cons of phytoestrogens - Front Neuroendocrinol - 2010 - p4](https://web.archive.org/web/20190928181945/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3074428/pdf/nihms271669.pdf)\n\nIn other words, it's possible for human cell growth to be increased by phytoestrogens.\n\n\u003e Phytoestrogens are plant‐derived [small amounts can also be found in animal products, see above] dietary compounds with structural similarity to 17‐β‐oestradiol (E2), the primary female sex hormone. This structural similarity to E2 enables phytoestrogens to cause (anti)oestrogenic effects by binding to the oestrogen receptors.  \n\u003e [...]  \n\u003e [P]hytoestrogens are also considered endocrine disruptors, indicating that they have the potential to cause adverse health effects such as infertility and increased risks of cancer in oestrogen-sensitive organs.  \n\u003e - [The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens - British Journal of Pharmacology](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922065924/https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.13622)  \n\nPhytoestrogens have a similar shape to human estorogen, which enables them to interrupt the normal absorption of human estrogen in the endocrine (hormonal) system.\n\n\u003e Phytoestrogens produce estrogenic, anti-estrogenic or no activity depending upon the tissue.

          "rawContent": "\n# Popular Fact\n\n\u003e Soy's phytoestrogens cause a variety of negative health effects due to interfering with hormones.\n\nSee our article: [Soy contains estrogen]({{\u003cref \"/facts/soy-contains-estrogen\"\u003e}}) for more information on phytoestrogens.\n\n# Reality\nTalkVeganToMe's layman's understanding from surveying the material available online is that: \n\n1. Soy contains phytoestrogens which are structurally similar to human estrogen (specifically *isoflavones*) which can have hormonal effects on the body.\n2. The maximum safe dosages are not well understood. \n3. It is _unlikely_ that you will ingest a high enough dosage to affect your health as part of a balanced diet provided you do not have any special circumstances (e.g. hypothyroidism, infancy, etc.). But you should ensure that you vary your protein sources and consult your dietitian for special circumstances (e.g. hypothyroidism, infancy, etc.) see *Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - 2018* below.  \n4. All articles on the topic caveat their conclusions with: 'more research is needed'.  \n  \n\nThis is a highly complex and fast moving topic in terms of research. We've discounted a number of the most popular pro-soy sources (see *Conflicts of Interest* below). We've also intentionally put the position of the Vegan Society to one side until we understand the original sources properly (see *Vegan Society* below).\n\nWhat remains is the truest representation of the research we've surveyed from our layman's ability to digest them. Despite assessing nearly [80 articles and meta-analyses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTayf4Bn7PT7xHNrQ_ehIQV_8gTWRLN9of5Kfm_GuPf9CAPtJ5hZfxEAvTvZub_orWOuPrCxIr7RpTq/pubhtml) we have relied particularly heavily on [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/) as it is a highly relevant, highly recent, and seemingly unbiased meta-analysis of the research.\n\nYou may come to a different conclusion based on the evidence provided, which is why we have cited, quoted, and linked to our sources so you can make an informed decision. If you wish to reach us regarding anything we've said in this article, please contact [support@talkveganto.me](mailto:support@talkveganto.me)\n\n\n## 1. Phytoestrogens can have hormonal (and anti-hormonal) effects.\n\nThis was our biggest surprise in researching this topic, as we had heard over and over again that soy contained _plant_ estrogen, you don't need to worry about plant estrogen as they can't interact with the human body hormonally!\n\nUnfortunately phytoestrogens are not so easily dismissed. See *[Soy contains estrogen]({{\u003cref \"/facts/soy-contains-estrogen\"\u003e}})* for more.\n\n## 2. Dosage is hard to understand\n\nThis assertion is based on:\n\n1. How much phytoestrogen is in food varies wildly\n2. How much is safe to eat is not well understood\n\n\n### 2.1 Hard to tell how much phytoestrogen is in food\nThe amount of phytoestrogens (e.g. isoflavones) in soy based products varies wildly depending on the product, the origin of the soybeans, and the cooking method.  \n\nEven if there were a Recommended Daily Allowance, it would be quite hard to tell whether you were above or below it based on the nutritional information available.  \n\n\u003e In Canada, isoflavones [a type of phytoestrogen] in soy beans vary from 360 to 2241 mg per kg. Isoflavones content in soy beans from Romania ranged between 210 and 1340 g per kg, 1176-3309 mg per kg in USA  and 525-986 mg per kg in India. \n\u003e - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p7](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)\n\nSo even at the source the amount of isoflavones per kg can vary massively depending on the local conditions of the crop.\n\n\u003e In soy flour, total isoflavone concentrations range from 60 to 265 mg per 100 g, tofu may contain between 5.1 and 64 mg per 100 g of total isoflavones, soy milk 1.3-21 mg per 100 g, tempeh 6.9-63 mg per 100 g, soy sauce 0.1-2.3 mg per 100 g, miso 23-126 mg per 100 g and natto 20-124 mg per 100 g.  \n\u003e [...]  \n\u003e Temperature is critical for retention of isoflavones: in fact, soymilk film formed during boiling, called Foo joke or Yuba, has been reported to have 196.05 mg per 100 g of isoflavone compared to 44.67 mg per 100 g after cooking   \n\u003e [...]  \n\u003e The most refined soy foods can lose up to 80-90% of isoflavone content during processing. Soy burgers have 0.1-26 mg per 100 g of total aglycone equivalents, soy yogurts 1.6-11.8 mg per 100 g, soy drinks 1.0-21 mg per 100 g and soy cheeses 2.3-33 mg per 100 g. Usually, bakery soy-based products retain low concentration of isoflavones. Soy milk formulas may contain up to 31 mg per 100 g.  \n\u003e - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p18](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)\n\nIn other words, foods containing soy can have very unpredictable amounts of phytoestrogens, processed foods can lose a lot of their isoflavone content, and typically cooking soy based foods reduces the amount of isoflavones dramatically.\n\n\n### 2.2 How much is safe to eat is not well understood.\n\nWhile there is no RDA currently published by any body we've been able to find, there are some indications of what might constitute a dosage which would have an effect on the body.  \n\n\u003e At the same time, to have the beneficial effects of soy isoflavones, intake should be at least of 60-100 mg per day, at present not easily reached in Western countries.  \n\u003e - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p21](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)\n\nThis talks specifically about beneficial effects (which has been the focus of a lot of research due to health claims for tofu in the 1990s), the full scope of large dosages of phytoestrogens (whatever may constitute large dosages!) can have negative effects.\n\n\u003e There are also real concerns that excessive amounts of isoflavones in serum may promote other hormone-related problems.  \n\u003e - [An updated review of dietary isoflavones: Nutrition, processing, bioavailability and impacts on human health - Critical Reviews in Food Scient and Nutrition - 2017](http://web.archive.org/web/20191015205851/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Humayoun_Akhtar/publication/283791348_An_Updated_Review_of_Dietary_Isoflavones_Nutrition_Processing_Bioavailability_and_Impacts_on_Human_Health/links/5a2f732a4585155b617a45fd/An-Updated-Review-of-Dietary-Isoflavones-Nutrition-Processing-Bioavailability-and-Impacts-on-Human-Health.pdf?origin=publication_detail)\n\nand \n\n\u003e [P]hytoestrogens are also considered endocrine disruptors, indicating that they have the potential to cause adverse health effects such as infertility and increased risks of cancer in oestrogen-sensitive organs.  \n\u003e - [The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens - British Journal of Pharmacology - 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922065924/https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.13622)  \n\nThat said, the few studies that show negative effects have major drawbacks such as:\n\n1. Being performed on animals, which apart from the ethical concerns do not even necessarily yield valid results for humans!  \n2. Being performed in-vitro (i.e. in a petri-dish on small clusters of cells)\n3. Drawing conclusions from statistical (e.g. epidiemological) data which risks confusing mere correlation with cause.\n\n\n\u003e  These adverse effects have been mainly suggested based on data from in vitro, animal or epidemiological studies. Clinical studies often report the absence of adverse effects. \n\u003e - [The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens - British Journal of Pharmacology - 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922065924/https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.13622)  \n\nand\n\n\u003e Concerns about the adverse effect of soy consumption were originally based on animal data.  \n\u003e - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)\n\n\n## 3. It's unlikely you'll ingest enough to have adverse effects, but vary your protein intake anyway!\n\nHaving a varied plant-based diet is rarely bad advice. And while it seems like you are unlikely to eat enough to adversely affect your health, it's also pretty much impossible to measure how much phytoestrogen you're ingesting on a daily basis without specialised equipment. And even if you could, there are no official recommended daily allowances to stay below.\n\n\u003e Overall, the low content of bioactive compounds in second generation soy foods [(e.g. soy based mock meats)] and moderate amounts in traditional soy preparations offer modest health benefits with very limited risk for potential adverse health effects.  \n\u003e - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p21](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)\n\nAn interesting point in the same meta-analysis was:\n\n\u003e [T]o have the beneficial effects of soy isoflavones, intake should be at least of 60-100 mg per day, at present not easily reached in Western countries.  \n\u003e - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p21](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)\n\n\n\n## 4. More research is needed\nThis was repeated by _every single study_ we read. Dietary conclusions are extremely difficult to come to as they can be affected by everything from genetics of the person ingesting it, to the conditions in which the crops were grown, to even the way the food is cooked.\n\nThis article will likely be updated in the future as new studies come out. But for now the answer is a firm: nobody quite knows for sure.\n\n\u003e Despite the high intakes in Asian countries, there is still a paucity of long term data on soy consumption in Western countries. Currently, the use of soy foods in infancy, including soy-based infant formulas, was not linked to adverse events. However, absence of evidence is not an evidence of absence. With the growing adoption of vegetarian diets and with the choice of soy formulas by Western vegetarian parents, a broader characterization of the role of soy foods in Western nutrition could help the acceptance of plant-based new generation foods.  \n\u003e - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)\n\nand\n\n\u003e Having said that more rigorous studies are required to assess dose-response relationships while consuming soy food and supplementation.  \n\u003e - [An updated review of dietary isoflavones: Nutrition, processing, bioavailability and impacts on human health - Critical Reviews in Food Scient and Nutrition - 2017](http://web.archive.org/web/20191015205851/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Humayoun_Akhtar/publication/283791348_An_Updated_Review_of_Dietary_Isoflavones_Nutrition_Processing_Bioavailability_and_Impacts_on_Human_Health/links/5a2f732a4585155b617a45fd/An-Updated-Review-of-Dietary-Isoflavones-Nutrition-Processing-Bioavailability-and-Impacts-on-Human-Health.pdf?origin=publication_detail)\n\nand\n\n\u003e Given the rapid increase in global consumption of phytoestrogens and the fact that phytoestrogens are present in a wide range of dietary food supplements and widely marketed as a natural alternative to oestrogen replacement therapy, further insight into the risks and benefits of these phytoestrogens seems essential.  \n\u003e - [The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens - British Journal of Pharmacology - 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922065924/https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.13622)  \n\n\n\n\n# Vegan Society \u0026 British Association of Dietitians\n\n\u003e Evidence suggests that soya is not a threat to our health and is in fact a reliable and healthy protein source.  \n\u003e - [Vegan Society - General FAQs](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002203547/https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/general-faqs)\n\nTalkVeganToMe reached out to The Vegan Society to enquire after the sources for the evidence. The Vegan Society replied incredibly promptly and directed us to The British Association of Dietitian's as their source.\n\n\u003e There is now scientific agreement that the controversy around isoflavones’ potential to have bad side effects in humans is fuelled only by findings from laboratory or animal studies using pure isoflavones or high doses. It is well established that animals metabolise isoflavones in a different and much more efficient way to humans and results from such studies cannot be compared to any human outcomes. Additionally, using high doses of pure isoflavones cannot be compared to consuming isoflavones from whole soya foods as they provide lower quantities and are a combination of many biologically active molecules.

[p7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w)\n\nIt appears that the 46% figure is taken by using the total tonnage figures of Table 1 [p7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w) and applying the following formula.  \n\n\u003e N type tonnage * Percentage of N tonnage that is nets / Total tonnage = Percentage of total that is nets  \n\u003e 41,376 * 86% / 78,909 = 45%  \n\nWhich... is not quite 46% but it seems reasonable that we are subject to a rounding error here given we do not have the original numbers in full fidelity.  \n\n### Methodology\n\nThe study combines observations from vessel expeditions with satellite imaging [p2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w) to draw conclusions about the overall composition of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch by sampling a smaller area. Their methodology is essentially gathering all the plastic from a sample area, weighing the various types of plastic in that area is, and then multiplying those weights by the total size of the GPGP.\n\n### The majority of the rest\n\nThe National Geographic article cites 46% and then goes on to say \"the majority of the rest [is] composed of fishing industry gear\".  \nThe closest to a supporting statement for this in the study is:  \n\n\u003e  [W]e predominantly observed debris originated from marine sources [p5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w)  \n\nWhich is expanded upon later with: \n\n\u003e  [A]t least half of the collected GPGP plastics was composed of objects from marine based sources, while the relative source amplitudes considered in our model predicted that mass contributions from land-based plastics, even though lower than global average, would still dominate in these ofshore environments. This discrepancy could be due to diferences in the magnitude of certain removal processes between land-based and marine-based plastics that were not accounted for in our models. We trust that beaching is one of these processes as it may primarily remove plastics that are discarded in coastal environments through wave, tidal and onshore winds transport. Nonetheless, the GPGP dominance of marine-sourced plastics could also be attributed to their purposely engineered durability in the marine environment (e.g. strong and thick-walled nets, traps, ropes, and foats used by marine industries) as well as overestimations of land-based sources and/or underestimations of marine-based sources. [p12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w)  \n\nSo although 'at least half' are from marine sources, this _may_ be because land sources of plastic are more likely to wash up, _or_ because plastic from the land breaks up more easily as it's not designed to survive in the sea unlike marine plastics.  \nIn other words, while more than half of the observable plastic in the GPGP is from marine sources, that doesn't mean that most of the plastic going into the ocean is from marine sources.\n\n\n# Sources\n\n- [National Geographic - The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Isn’t What You Think it Is - March 2018](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/03/great-pacific-garbage-patch-plastics-environment/)\n- [Nature - Evidence that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is rapidly accumulating plastic - March 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w)\n",

In the graph it suggests that it takes 70-80L of water per 200ml of Almond Milk. Taking the middle point (75L) that gives us **375L** of water to produce 1L of Almond Milk (or 99 US Gallons per litre).  \n\nTo understand this figure better I reached out to Joseph Poore via email and ze explained that zir figures were based on an confidential Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) from an almond milk production company and based on that LCA confirmed that:\n\n\u003e [I used] the post-farm data for soymilk (almond milk processing isn’t a major user of water, so this is a good proxy)  \n\u003e - Joseph Poore - Email to Author - 2019\n\nJoseph also pointed out that there was a huge difference in the footprint between US and European sourced almonds because the Floridian almonds sourced in the US are predominantly irrigated and the Spanish almonds sourced in Europe and rainfed. For the statistics in the BBC article ze took global data for almond water usage.\n\n\n## Almond Milk vs. Cow Milk Life Cycle Assessment - Jacqueline Ho, Ingrid Maradiaga, et al. - 2016\n\nThis figure is the average of two calculations, one partly based on an industry analysis and one wholly based on a statistical model. The former is as follows:\n\n\u003e Almond production + almond processing =  \n\u003e 0.20113 kgal + 1.068555 kgal = 1.269685 kgal water / 1L almond milk  \n\u003e [Almond Milk vs. Cow Milk Life Cycle Assessment - 2016 - p13](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf)\n\nThe first figure of 201 gallons per litre of almonond milk (consumed in the growing of the almonds) is derived from [Almond Eco­Efficiency Analysis (BASF Corporation, 2011)](http://www.nsfturkey.com/newsroom_pdf/Almond_EEA_Study_Verification_Final_August_2011.pdf). The second figure of 1,068 gallons per 1 litre of Almond milk (consumed in the processing of almonds into milk) is the vast majority of the total and is rather suspect. \n\n### Almond Processing Figure\nDue to a lack of statistical data regarding almond processing, the almond processing figure (1,068 gallons of water to 1 litre of almond milk) is derived using the ratio of water usage in soybean production to soybean processing. [p11](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf).\n\nThe ratio of water usage in producing vs processing soybeans came out as 0.83x  [p11](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf) (i.e. producing the soybeans took 0.83x as much water as processing them). \n\nIt seems very strange to use a ratio of water to grow vs water to process for this, as just because almonds take more water to grow, it does not follow that they take more to process.  It seems far more likely (without evidence to the contrary) that the amount of water to process soybeans is _broadly_ similar. The amount of water used to process soybeans they cite is 136 gallons [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf). It seems staggering to believe that almonds use more than 8x as much water for processing as soybeans without any additional details on the process.\n\nThis ratio of 0.83x is then applied to 0.885 kgal for farming.  \n\n\u003e 0.82822086 = Tree nut farming / x  \n\u003e 0.82822086 = 0.885 kgal / x  \n\u003e x = 1.068555 kgal water used in processing almonds into almond milk  \n\u003e - [p13](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf) \n\nThis gives us the 1,068 gallons of water used in the processing of almonds into milk to yield to 1 litre of milk.\nBut where does the 0.885 kgal come from?\n\nThe 0.885 kgal figure was calculated using the [EIOCLA US 2002 Benchmark Producer Price Model - Tree Nut Farming](http://www.eiolca.net/cgi-bin/dft/display.pl?hybrid=no\u0026first_level_sector=-1\u0026second_level_sector=111335\u0026newmatrix=US430CIDOC2002\u0026key=7216147368\u0026value=0244216612\u0026incdemand=0.0000017858\u0026selectvect=water\u0026select_button1=Run+Model) with an input of the average retail price of almond milk per litre (1.7858$/litre) [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf). The EIOCLA is a rather clever statistical model that uses data from [a variety of public sources](http://www.eiolca.net/docs/full-document-2002-042310.pdf) to calculate the environmental impact of various industries per million dollars of the _producer_ price. \n\nTo be clear, they are using data on the amount of water it takes to grow (produce) nuts to infer the amount of water it takes to process the (already grown) nuts into milk\n\nThe dollar value input for the EIOCLA model is naturally crucial, and the tutorial for the calculator warns:\n\n\u003e The dollar value entered represents producer price - the cost to make the output; it is not the consumer price - the cost to purchase the output. For an average automobile, the producer price is around $20,000. A consumer would purchase this average vehicle for $25,000 to $30,000.  \n\u003e - [EICLA Tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20190606115219/http://www.eiolca.net/tutorial-new/tut_3.html)\n\nUnfortunately it seems that in this study, the retail price has been used, inflating the results significantly. The study justifies this by saying:  \n\n\u003e We are assuming that the cost of packaging is negligible thereby allowing us to use the retail price as the economic activity for EIOLCA.  \n\u003e -  [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf)\n\nBut this ignores retail markup, distribution costs, not to mention the fact that the dataset we're working against is for the _Tree Nut Farming_ industry [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf), not the almond _milk_ industry which skews the result due to the farming industry having a much lower 'producer price' (price the farmer/factory sells it at) by virtue of being further back in the value chain.\n\nWe therefore regard the numbers cited here for almond processing as _highly_ suspect due to:  \n\n1. The conflation of retail and producer pricing\n2. The conflation of nut milk producer pricing and nut farming producer pricing\n3. The inference of processing water usage from farming water usage (two **completely** unrelated numbers)\n4. The assumption that the ratio (0.83x) of production (farming) water usage to processing (almonds into milk) water usage from data regarding soybeans somehow applies to almonds.\n\nUsing the datasets and methodologies that the study provides it is impossible to come to a reliable conclusion regarding the total water usage per litre of almond milk.\n\n#### Speculating further\n\nOut of curiousity however, we can use the data the authors provided to make two still unsupportable, but arguably more accurate calculations for water usage per litre of almond milk. \n\n**Use soybeans' processing water usage per litre as a comparison**\n\n\u003e Almond Farming + Soybean Processing = Approximate Total gallons per litre of milk  \n\u003e   0.20113 kgal [p13](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf) + 0.136 kgals [p12](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf) = Approximate Total  \n\u003e Approximate Total = 0.33713 kgals  \n\nSo our total would be 337 gallons of water per litre of almond milk rather than their cited 1,611. This makes the assumption that almond processing takes exactly as much water as soybean processing, but that seems a more defensible assumption than the _wild_ speculation of the figures based on the model. (See the 4 bullet points above for why.)\n\n**Use the [Almond Eco­Efficiency Analysis](http://www.nsfturkey.com/newsroom_pdf/Almond_EEA_Study_Verification_Final_August_2011.pdf) figure with the 0.83 ratio**\n\n\u003e Almond Farming Water Usage / Almond Processing Water Usage = 0.83 [p11](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf))  \n\u003e  0.2 kgals / x = 0.83  \n\u003e  x = 0.24 kgals  \n\u003e Almond Processing Water Usage = 240 gallons\n\nWhich would make our total (Almond Farming + Almond Processing): 0.44 kgallons, or 440 gallons of water to make 1 litre of almond milk rather than the cited 1,611 gallons.\n\n**Important:** The calculation above is still completely spurious and is merely an extrapolation based on the article's own unfounded assumption of a universally applicable ratio between farming water usage and processing water usage.\n\n\n# Sources\n\n- [The Guardian - Ditch the almond milk: why everything you know about sustainable eating is probably wrong - 2018](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/05/ditch-the-almond-milk-why-everything-you-know-about-sustainable-eating-is-probably-wrong)\n- [Almond Milk vs. Cow Milk Life Cycle Assessment - 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20181003201254/https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/cow-vs-almond-milk-1.pdf)\n- [EICLA Tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20190606115219/http://www.eiolca.net/tutorial-new/tut_3.html)\n- [EIOCLA US 2002 Benchmark Producer Price Model - Tree Nut Farming](http://www.eiolca.net/cgi-bin/dft/display.pl?hybrid=no\u0026first_level_sector=-1\u0026second_level_sector=111335\u0026newmatrix=US430CIDOC2002\u0026key=7216147368\u0026value=0244216612\u0026incdemand=0.0000017858\u0026selectvect=water\u0026select_button1=Run+Model)\n- [Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers - Poore and Nemecek - 2018](http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/rapidpdf/360/6392/987?ijkey=ffyeW1F0oSl6k\u0026keytype=ref\u0026siteid=sci) via [josephpoore.com](https://josephpoore.com/)\n- [BBC News - Climate change: Which vegan milk is best? - 2019](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46654042)",

          "rawContent": "\n\n# Popular Fact\nThis fact appears to have become popular through the following New York Times quote from 2009.\n\n \u003e As much as 70 percent of areas newly cleared for agriculture in Mato Grosso State in Brazil is being used to grow soybeans.  \n \u003e [New York Times - The Carnivore's Dilemma - 2009](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/31/opinion/31niman.html)\n\nUnhelpfully this article provides no citation, so we are forced to consult Google which reveals a study regarding Mato Grosso we can use as reference which was published a year after the New York Times article (but does not support the 70% statistic). See the Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. metanalysis below.\n\n# Reality\n\n\u003e Recent deforestation in the Legal Amazon was predominantly due to cattle ranching not soybean expansion.  \n\u003e Globally 77% of the annual soybean harvest is fed to livestock, meaning that the vast majority of soybean production is driven by meat production.  \n\u003e - TalkVeganToMe\n\nThe above quote is a combination of the findings of the below Nature article by David M. Lapola, Luiz A. Martinelli, et al. and the USDA statistics you can find in our article [Soy Fed to Livestock]({{\u003c ref \"/facts/soy-fed-to-livestock\"\u003e}}).\n\n## Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon\n\nThis metanalysis is included as a contemporary of the New York Times quote.\n\n\u003e A more recent study by an environmental organization and a soybean trade group analyzed 250 m resolution MODIS scenes containing 630 sample areas of deforested land in Mato Grosso, and found that only 12 sample areas (0.88% in terms of area) were in soy cultivation, while nearly 200 were converted to pasture land (32% in terms of area) (Greenpeace-Brazil 2009).\n\u003e  - [Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon - April 2010](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/2/024002/meta)\n\nThe most relevant stat here is the 0.88% used for soy cultivation which is cited as [Greenpeace Brazil - Amazon Cattle Footprint. Mato Grosso: State of Destruction - 2009 - p15](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/research/amazon-cattle-footprint-mato/). However, the article itself seems to provide no breakdown, nor even mention of the 630 sample areas, or 12 sample areas being in soy cultivation. The stat actually seems to come from a [press release from Abiove](http://www.abiove.com.br/english/sustent/bs_edicao015_abr09_us.pdf) (see below).\n\nHowever, the metanalysis goes on to conclude   \n\n\u003e The proximate cause of deforestation in the Legal Amazon was predominantly the expansion of pasture, and not of soybeans. However, in Mato Grosso, an increase in soybeans occurred in regions previously used for pasture, which may have displaced pastures further north into the forested areas, causing indirect deforestation there. Therefore, soybean cultivation may still be one of the major underlying causes of deforestation in the Legal Amazon.  \n\n\u003e  - [Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon - April 2010 ](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/2/024002/meta)\n\nThis does not provide any stats however, so we are ultimately no closer to validating the 70% figure other to conclude that the research available at the time of the New Yorker suggested that: \n\n\u003e [R]ecent deforestation in the Legal Amazon was predominantly due to cattle ranching (Morton et al 2006, Brown et al 2005, Greenpeace-Brazil 2009), and not soybean expansion.  \n\u003e  - [Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. - The role of pasture and soybean in deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon - April 2010](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/2/024002/meta)\n\n## Nature - David M. Lapola, Luiz A. Martinelli, et al. - Pervasive transition of the Brazilian land-use system\n\nTo give us some context for the trend of Brazilian Deforestation we can refer to a 2014 study published in Nature.\n\n\u003e  Despite this pressure, there has been a prominent decline in overall deforestation since 2005: from an annual average of ~18,000 km2 in the 1990–2004 period to ~10,500 km2 in 2005–2012, with the lowest rate ever of 4,571  km2 in 2012  \n\u003e - David M. Lapola, Luiz A. Martinelli, et al. - Pervasive transition of the Brazilian land-use system - p29\n\nThis gives us a reduction of 75% in the speed at which the Amazon rainforest is being deforested between the 1990s and 2012 which is useful context for understanding the context for these figures. Even more interestingly:\n\n\u003e Pastures for beef production remain the dominant land use, occupying 60% to 80% of deforested land  \n\u003e - David M. Lapola, Luiz A. Martinelli, et al. - Pervasive transition of the Brazilian land-use system - p29\n\nThe article cites this statistic as coming from the [TerraClass Land-use Database](http://inpe-em.ccst.inpe.br/en/papers/terraclass-amazon-land-use-database-2/) as of Sept 2013.\n\n## Abiove - Soy Moratorium contributes to containment of deforestation in the Amazon Biome - 2009 \n\u003e [T]he Soy Moratorium monitored this year’s crop, including a field survey, mainly by flyovers, in 630 areas that were deforested after July 2006, with the objective of checking onsite land use and occupation in the selected areas. Soy planting was identified in only 12 polygons[...]  \n\u003e The 12 polygons cover a deforested area of 2,157 hectares, of which 1,385 hectares were planted with soy. For comparison purposes, this year’s monitoring covered 157,898 deforested hectares. [...]  \n\u003e Satellite images, panoramic and close-up photographs of all 630 monitored polygons are available on ABIOVE’s site, www.abiove.com.br.

However the metanalysis by Elizabeth Barona, Navin Ramankutty, et al. above suggests it may not be the whole story.\n\n# Sources\n\n- [Mother Nature Network - Tofu-eaters please don't gloat](https://web.archive.org/web/20091105065606/http://www.mnn.com/technology/research-innovations/blogs/tofu-eaters-please-dont-gloat) \n- [Greenpeace - Eating up the Amazon - 2006](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/wp-content/uploads/legacy/Global/usa/report/2010/2/eating-up-the-amazon.pdf?53ea6e)\n- [Reuters - Cattle, not soy, drives Amazon deforestation - 2009](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN14438957)\n- David M.

Those who abstain from eating animal-based foods can eat a variety of protein-containing plant foods each day in order to get all the amino acids needed to make new protein, and also choose to incorporate complete plant proteins like quinoa and chia seeds.   \n\u003e - [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)\n\nThis means that variety is key in a vegan diet (as in any diet), to ensure you get a complete source of proteins.\n\nThe same (non-vegan) Harvard source even goes on to recommend plant protein sources over animal ones.\n\n\u003e Get your protein from plants when possible. Eating legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, whole grains, and other plant-based sources of protein is a win for your health and the health of the planet. If most of your protein comes from plants, make sure that you mix up your sources so no “essential” components of protein are missing. The good news is that the plant kingdom offers plenty of options to mix and match.   \n\u003e - [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)\n\n\n##  Resources\n- [USDA Nutrition Database](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list)\n- [Challenge 22](https://challenge22.com/)\n- [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/)",

          "rawContent": "\n# Water Usage\n\n\u003e 2,500 gallons of water are needed to produce 1 pound of beef. [Cowspiracy](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)\n\n# Original Sources\n[Waterfootprint.org](https://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/product-water-footprint/water-footprint-crop-and-animal-products/) has some great stats and scholarly sources for this information.\nTheir statistic is that 15,415 litres of water are required to produce one kilogram of beef, which works out as about 1850 US gallons per pound.\n\n\u003e Most of the total volume of water (98%) refers to the water footprint of the feed for the animals. Drinking water for the animals, service water and feed mixing water account only for 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.03%, respectively.\n\nTheir primary source is [Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2010)](https://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Hoekstra-2014-Water-for-animal-products_1.pdf)\n\n# Criticisms\n\n## Comparison\nThe statistic above citing water usage is relatively meaningless without the context of what the alternative consumes.\nFortunately the [Waterfootprint.org](https://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/product-water-footprint/water-footprint-crop-and-animal-products/) article allows us to contrast on a litre-to-calorie basis, which shows that cereals (e.g. wheat, oats, barley, etc.) require 0.51 litres per kilocalorie in contrast to beef's 10.19, and chicken's 3 litres.\n\n## Grass fed meat\nAs the statistic above shows the _vast_ majority of the water consumption for animal products comes from producing the feed, carnists will often try to discredit it on the basis that it does not apply as 'water consumption' when animals are eating grass on naturally occuring plains.\n\nThe rebuttal from [Eishel, Gordon, et al.](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/33/11996.full) is worth quoting here.\n\n\u003e A possible objection to the [conclusion that beef uses 160x more land than potatoes/wheat/rice] is that beef production partly relies on pastureland in the arid west[ern United States], land that is largely unfit for any other cultivation form. [... T]he objection ignores other societal benefits those arid lands may provide, notably ecosystem services and biodiversity. It further ignores the ≈0.16 million km2 of high-quality cropland used for grazing and the ≈0.46 million km2 of grazing land [..] that can thus be diverted to food production. Even when focusing only on agricultural land, beef still towers over the other categories. This can be seen by excluding pasture resources and summing only crops and processed roughage (mostly hay and silage, whose production claims prime agricultural land that can be hypothetically diverted to other crops). After this exclusion, 1 Mcal of beef still requires ≈15 m2 land (Fig. 2A), about twofold higher than the second least-efficient [animal product] category.\n\nIn simpler terms:  \n\n1. Even if you exclude the land the cattle grazes on it uses 15 square metres of land per thousand calories to raise beef due to the harvested hay and silage (compacted grass feed). \n2. Removing the cattle from the pastureland would promote biodiversity even if it was unsuitable for growing crops.\n3. There are 0.62 _million_ square kilometeres (which is slightly larger than then entirety of France) of pastureland that are suitable for crops in the United States.\n4. We don't _need_ beef, or any other animal products to shore up our calorie or protein intake, as [acre for acre plants are on average 100 to 160 times more efficient]({{\u003cref \"/facts/land-usage.md\"\u003e}}).\n\nThe stats from the quote cite land usage, but the argument stands (though the numbers differ) for water usage.\n\n\n## Citations\n - [Eishel, Gordon, et al. \"Land, irrigation water, greenhouse gas, reactive nitrogen burdens of meat, eggs and dairy production in the United States\".

Animals are killed/stunned using methods such as electrocution, masceration, and asphyixation in a Co2 chamber, which if you want to beleive this is a humane method we suggest watching the first 15 minutes of [Dominion]({{\u003c ref \"/vegan-culture/documentaries\"\u003e}}).  \nAdditionally the stunning methods are often ineffective (see below for stats for each method). \n\n## Slaughter \u0026 Stunning Methods\n\n### Captive bolt\n\nWith this slaughter method, a 'gun' fires a metal bolt into the brain of the animal causing it to lose consciousness. This is typically used on larger animals (e.g. cows) and is fallible due to the accuracy required and the movement of the panic-stricken animals making precision difficult. According to a 2013 study: \n\n\u003e Inadequate stunning occurred in 12.5% [of cases]  \n\u003e - [Assessment of stun quality at commercial slaughter in cattle shot with captive bolt  - S Atkinson, A Velarde, B Algers - 2013 - p476](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/760f/630e835608a203f552c1ded7f7370ca02536.pdf).\n\nGiven the study was conducted with a observer present one would assume this represents a best case scenario as well, as the slaughterhouse workers will be trying to give their best impressions to comply with EU regulations.\n\nThis means that more than one in ten cattle went to be 'stuck' fully conscious, on top of the experience of queueing up to be slaughtered.\n\n### Electrical\n\nFor medium-sized animals (pigs, sheep, calves), this is performed through 'tongs' placed on either side of the animals head in order to pass a current through the brain and render them temporarily unconscious. In some cases, it can also be applied to the animal's heart in order to provide a lethal shock. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\nFor chickens, this takes the form of an 'electric bath', where chickens are hung upside down by their legs and forced into an electrified vat of water to stun them, prior to their throats being slit by a rotating blade. [RSPCA UK](https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/farm/slaughter/factfile)\n\nAccording to a 2009 study conducted in Holland:\n\n\u003e Based on the observed differences in technical settings (V, Hz), and between animal differences in impedance and between animal differences in sensitivity, it is highly probable that large numbers of birds are inadequately stunned during current usage of the water bath technique in slaughterhouses.  \n\u003e - [Electrical water bath stunning of poultry.

Estimates have been made for non-reporting countries as well as for countries reporting incomplete data. However, in certain countries, data for chickens, ducks and turkeys do not yet seem to represent the total number of these birds. Certain other countries give a single figure for all poultry; data for these countries are shown under “Chickens”. [...]  \n\u003e  Data relate to animals slaughtered within national boundaries, irrespective of their origin. All data shown relate to total meat production, that is, from both commercial and farm\nslaughter. Data are given in terms of dressed carcass weight, excluding offal and slaughter fats.   \n\u003e The compilation of the data domain has been made possible by the cooperation of\ngovernments, which have supplied most of the information in the form of replies to annual\nFAO questionnaires.   \n\u003e - [FAO Methodology Document](http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/documents/QL/QL_methodology_e.pdf)\n\nTwo pieces of this are slightly confusing:  \n\n\u003e  The data on livestock numbers are intended to cover all domestic animals irrespective of their age and the place or purpose of their breeding.  \n\nThis appears to refer to a separate dataset than the one we're inspecting, i.e. 'Live animals'.  \n\n\u003e Data are given in terms of dressed carcass weight, excluding offal and slaughter fats.   \n\nAgain, this refers to a separate set of statistics within the same dataset which refer to tonnes of animal flesh, not our statistics which are 'per head'.\n\n\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [BiteSizeVegan - Quantifying Suffering, Cruelty by the Numbers](http://www.bitesizevegan.org/bite-size-vegan-nuggets/qa/quantifying-suffering-cruelty-by-the-numbers/)\n\n\n",

Diet for a New America, StillPoint Publishing, 1987, p. 352'.\n\n## John Robbins' Diet for a new America\n\n\u003e To supply one person with a meat habit food for a year requires three and a quarter acres. To supply one lacto-ovo vegetarian with food for a year requires one-half acre. To supply one pure vegetarian requires only one-sixth of an acre. In other words, a given acreage can feed 20 times as many people eating a pure vegetarian diet-style as it could people eating the standard American diet-style [Diet for a new American p344 as PDF](https://ia802904.us.archive.org/21/items/JohnRobbinsDietForANewAmerica/John_Robbins_Diet_for_a_New_America.pdf)\n\nThis in turn cites \n- Aaron Altschul - Proteins: Their Chemistry and Politics - 1965 - p264. \n\n## Aaron Altschul - Proteins: Their Chemistry and Politics - 1965\n\nDue to its age, this book was quite hard to track down. Fortunately we were able to secure a copy from the British Library.\n\n\u003e A meat and milk-based diet may require as much as 3 1/2 acres to provide one Standard Nutrition Unit.  \n\u003e [...W]hile six to seven standard Nutrition Units of a rice-and-beans diet in Japan are produced per acre. Therefore, depending upon the type of diet, the capacity of the land to support a population ranges from 20:1.  \n\u003e - Aaron Altschul - Proteins: Their Chemistry and Politics - 1965 - p264. \n\nFor a source, this cites 'Land Use and Food Production - Stamp, L.D, in Hunger: Can It Be Averted? 1961'\n\n## Land Use and Food Production - Stamp, L.D, - Hunger: Can It Be Averted? - 1961\n\nAgain this book required a trip to the British Library, and even they had to pull it from their offsite location in Yorkshire to bring it to the reading rooms.\n\n\u003e Some diets (meat and milk for example) are very extravagant of land; it may require as much as 3.5 acres to produce one [Standard Nutrition Unit (1,000,000 calories)] whereas a mainly wheat-bread basic diet requires under efficient cultivation only 0.25 acre, whilst the very intensive rice culture together with oceans in Japan produces 6-7 Units per acre. In 'carrying capacity' there is thus a range from at least 20 to 1.  \n\u003e - Land Usage and Food Production - Stamp, L.D. - Hunger: Can It Be Averted? - 1961 - p38\n\nIt is *not even vegan* because it includes fish (as per the 'together with oceans' comment).\n\nWhile there is no explicit citation, there is a note at the end of the article saying that 'Stamp, L. Dudley - Our Developing World, Faber, 1960' treats many of the topics mentioned above in more detail.\n\n## Stamp, L. Dudley - Our Developing World, Faber, 1960\n\n\u003e On each acre of farmed land - essentially on a dietary base of rice, double or treble cropped where possible, beans, sweet potatoes and other high Calorie foods - Japan can produce 6 or 7 [Standard Nutrition Units] or support that number of people per acre. Under American conditions, and with a meat-milk-fruit diet essentially extravagant of land, it takes some 2 1/2 acres or more to produce one SNU or support one person. It [sic] we then wish to stimulate an argument we can then say Japanese agriculture is 15 to 18 times as efficient as American!  \n\u003e - Stamp, L. Dudley - Our Developing World - 1960 - p113\n\nAnd here we have our original source. This page cites numbers from a table on the next page (p114)\n\n\u003e USA: 175 million population, 3.5 acres cultivated land per capita, 0.4 SNU per acre  \n\u003e Japan: 91.5 million population, 0.15 acres cultivated land per capita, 6.5 SNU per acre  \n\u003e  - Paraphrased version of table on p114 of Stamp, L. Dudley - Our Developing World \n\nAccording to the table 0.4 people can be supported by an acre of cultivated land in the USA (i.e. it takes 2.5 acres to support one person) and 6.5 people can be supported per acre in Japan (i.e it takes 1/6th of an acre to support one person)\n\nAlthough the table does not directly cite its sources elsewhere Dudley uses numbers on total food production from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation from 1948-1952 (referenced in tables on p72-p77) and the total cultivated land acreage from the UN FAO's 'Yearbook' from 1957 (referenced in tables on p40-p41).\n\nI believe zir calculation went approximately as follows:  \n\n\u003e country: total_harvest_calories / 1 SNU (1,000,000 calories) / total_cultivated_acreage = number_of_people_diet_feeds_per_acre  \n\u003e USA: ? (not cited) / 1,000,000 / 192,500,000 (inferred) = 0.4  \n\u003e Japan: ? (not cited) / 1,000,000 / 13,725,000 (inferred) = 6.5  \n\u003e - Paraphrased version of table on p114 of Stamp, L. Dudley - Our Developing World \n\nSo the 'vegan diet' which takes 1/6th of an acre is arrived at by dividing the total calorie production of Japan immediately post WWII by the number of acres of cultivated land and then further dividing that by the number of calories it takes in a year to support one person.  \nAnd the 'meat diet' of 3.5 acres seems to have been a rounded up version of the same calculation for the United States.  \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe 18-20 times land usage statistic _specifically_ is pretty untenable to quote so simplistically today for the following reasons:\n\n1. Comparing \"average diets\" is complex due to the huge variety in what people eat globally and even within the same country.\n2. This specific stat originally referred not to an average vegan diet but the average *Japanese* diet immediately post WWII\n3. The Japanese diet obviously included _fish_ and almost certainly included at least _some_ meat.\n4. Comparing meat and vegetable sources for efficiency needs to be heavily caveated with the regions the statistics were gathered from and the time period those statistics cover as these vary by region and year.\n5. The source for the food production stats are from the period 1948-1950.\n6. The original source does not unpack its exact calculations.\n7. There are much better, *much* more recent statistics we can draw upon.\n\nWe would suggest a much more supportable statement would be \n\n\u003e Beef consumed in the United States requires around 160x as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice for the same number of calories, and nearly 100x as much land for the same amount of protein.  \n\u003e - TalkVeganToMe \n\nThis information is based on the other source, 'Eishel, Gordon et al.' which you can find the details of below.\n\n### Eishel, Gordon, et al.\n\n\u003e Compared with the average resource intensities of [potatoes, wheat, and rice] per megacalorie, beef requires 160, 8, 11, and 19 times as much land, irrigation water, [GreenHouse Gas], and [Nitrogen Fertilizer], respectively, whereas the four nonbeef animal categories require on average 6, 0.5, 2, and 3 times as much, respectively.\n\u003e -  [Eishel, Gordon, et al. \"Land, irrigation water, greenhouse gas, reactive nitrogen burdens of meat, eggs and dairy production in the United States\". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Vol. 111 No. 33 June 2014](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/33/11996.full)\n\nIn simple terms, the above paragraph states that beef requires 160 times as much land as potatoes, wheat, or rice per 1,000 calories. The paper does _not_ make any claims regarding the overall efficiency of an 'average' vegan or vegetarian diet with the variety of plants required to make up a nutritionally complete (not to mention interesting) diet, but the numbers are pretty staggering nonetheless.\n\nAlthough not stated in so many words, they also provide the same statistics per kg of protein which shows that **beef takes almost 100 times** (98.2x precisely) as much land as rice, potatoes, or wheat to provide the same amount of protein.  \n\nThis is calculated by dividing the mean beef kg protein per square metre\n[Eishel Gordon Et Al Supporting Information Sheet \u003e Dataset S1 Excel Spreadsheet \u003e PartitioningPerProtein](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2014/07/19/1402183111.DCSupplemental/pnas.201402183SI.pdf) and dividing it by the average of rice, wheat, and potatoes' kg protein square metre numbers. You can see in the PartitioningPerCalorie sheet that this is the same calculation performed for their 160x as much land per calorie quote.\n\n### Possible Objections\n\nThe article also goes on to address the possible objection of the numbers being 'inflated' by the cattle grazing land which is otherwise unsuitable for cultivation.\n\n\u003e A possible objection to the above conclusion is that beef production partly relies on pastureland in the arid west[ern United States], land that is largely unfit for any other cultivation form. [... T]he objection ignores other societal benefits those arid lands may provide, notably ecosystem services and biodiversity. It further ignores the ≈0.16 million km2 of high-quality cropland used for grazing and the ≈0.46 million km2 of grazing land [..] that can thus be diverted to food production. Even when focusing only on agricultural land, beef still towers over the other categories. This can be seen by excluding pasture resources and summing only crops and processed roughage (mostly hay and silage, whose production claims prime agricultural land that can be hypothetically diverted to other crops). After this exclusion, 1 Mcal of beef still requires ≈15 m2 land (Fig. 2A), about twofold higher than the second least-efficient [animal product] category.\n\nIn simple terms, even if you exclude the land the cattle grazes on it uses 15 square metres of land per thousand calories to raise beef (36.5 times as much as potatoes)! Potatoes by comparison use 0.41 square metres per thousand calories - [Referenced Supporting Information PDF - S19](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2014/07/19/1402183111.DCSupplemental/pnas.201402183SI.pdf).\n\n# Alternative Presentations\n\nThese same statistics can be found in a myriad of different forms, you can find some of them below.\n\n## A Well Fed World - Why we need plant based approaches\nA Well Fed World in Collaboration with Plantrician Project produced a graphic which states:  \n\n\u003e [On a] standard American diet: 2 football fields (1.3 acres each) feeds 1 person per year  \n\u003e [On a] plant based diet: 2 football fields feeds 14 people per year\n\nThis originates from [Plantrician Project - Food Math 101](https://web.archive.org/web/20190103163621/https://plantricianproject.org/food-math-101)\n\n## Plantrician Project - Food Math 101\n\n\u003e In order to produce the Standard American Diet (SAD), heavily comprised of animal protein and dairy, it’s estimated that the equivalent of 2 football fields are required per person per year—with much of this allocated to growing the crops to feed the animals. Source: Lappe, Frances Moore. Diet for a Small Planet. 1982, page 69.  \nHer numbers were 3.25 acres which equals 2.5 football fields; so we used a more conservative two football fields assuming that some agricultural efficiencies have been gained since 1982.  \n\u003e [...]  \n\u003e By contrast, on just one football field of arable land, it’s estimated that food can be produced to feed 7 people for an entire year when they are consuming a predominantly plant-based diet.

[...] (5)  \n\u003e   [John Robbins' - Diet for a new America, p344 as PDF](https://ia802904.us.archive.org/21/items/JohnRobbinsDietForANewAmerica/John_Robbins_Diet_for_a_New_America.pdf)\n\nAnd when you look up reference 5 for chapter 12 you get:\n\n\u003e 5 See citations in note 3.  \n\nWhich takes you to the folowing rather annoying compound citation.\n\n\u003e 3 Frances Moore Lappé, Diet for a Small Planet, 10th ed. (New York: Ballantine Books,\n1982), 69; Aaron Altschul, Proteins: Their Chemistry and Politics (New York: Basic Books,\n1965), 264; Folke Doyring, “Soybeans,” Scientific American, February 1974.\n\nThe first citation being *Frances Moore Lappé, Diet for a Small Planet*, but the *correct* citation for the 1/6th of an acre statistic being *Aaron Altschul, Proteins: Their Chemistry and Politics*\n\nSo we _suspect_ that this an honest mistake on the part of the Plantrician Project; in providing an original source for the statistic they accidentally used the wrong citation from John Robbins' Diet for a new America. Unfortunately neither source is the original, and the original source does not pertain to a vegan diet at all, instead referring to post-WWII Japan (see Stamp, L.
